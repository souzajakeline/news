This question is insane.\u201d\u201cThere are people in Europe who\u2019ve had to flee because of war, economic factors, environmental disasters, people who simply want to be taken in,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have to ask what are we doing at the moment? We in Germany are doing very, very well, and when we say something like that, I think it\u2019s crazy how we turn a blind eye and simply block out such things.\u201dNagelsmann also said Kimmich was correct when he said a football team can be a role model for how different cultural, religious and ethnic backgrounds can join in a group successfully to work together for major goals.\u201cI always find it bizarre that we all go on vacation to get to know other cultures and then other cultures come here and we complain about it. It\u2019s bizarre,\u201d Nagelsmann said. \u201cSo, I can\u2019t go on vacation then. I always have to stay where I am.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re playing a European Championship for everyone in the country,\u201d the 36-year-old added. \u201cAnd anyone who can play top football is invited to be a national player and give their all for their country. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. And I hope I never have to read about such a crap survey again.\u201dGermany will play Ukraine on Monday in Nuremberg, in the hosts\u2019 first warmup game for Euro 2024. They then play Greece on Friday in M\u00f6nchengladbach, before opening the tournament against Scotland in Munich on 14 June.Nagelsmann\u2019s side will also face Hungary in Stuttgart on 19 June and Switzerland in Frankfurt on 23 June in their other Group A fixtures."}

The successful candidate, 31-year-old Amelia Hamer, is unlikely to step aside and says the changes to the boundaries of Kooyong may work in her favour.Frydenberg, the former treasurer and deputy Liberal leader, was defeated in 2022 by independent Monique Ryan and took a lucrative job at Goldman Sachs after leaving politics.Friday\u2019s proposed redistribution of Victorian seats abolished the seat of Higgins and made major changes to borders of other Melbourne electorates. The ABC reported Frydenberg was considering trying to run again, but would need the Victorian Liberal party to reopen nominations \u2013 a prospect strongly rebuffed by several Victorian Liberal sources on Sunday.Guardian Australia spoke to numerous Liberal MPs and party sources, both inside and outside Victoria, about the prospect of Frydenberg\u2019s return. Opinions were split, with some supportive, while others strongly urged against the idea of unseating the endorsed candidate.One MP said it would be a \u201cterrible look\u201d to ask Hamer to step aside, noting perceptions of the party having internal issues with gender equality. Several said women in the party had \u201cfrustrations\u201d about accessing opportunities for advancement and preselection, and that passing over Hamer would not soothe such concerns.Charlotte Mortlock, founder of the Hilma\u2019s Network advocacy group for Liberal women, said Frydenberg \u201chad ample opportunity months ago\u201d to run.\u201cAmelia is the exact demographic we need to win back. She is a more competitive candidate,\u201d Mortlock told Guardian Australia.\u201cIt is grossly condescending to expect or even ask a woman of her calibre to make way for a man because he\u2019s changed his mind four months later.\u201dMortlock\u2019s comments came after former Liberal MP Jason Falinski called Hamer \u201ca team player and she would understand we want to put our best people on the field\u201d.Others spoken to by Guardian Australia said it would be unfair to reopen preselection in Kooyong, considering other seats \u2013 like Deakin, Chisholm and Menzies \u2013 had been altered to similar or higher degrees. They questioned if the party would throw open ballots in all affected seats.Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court, a vocal critic of Frydenberg and convener of the Climate 200 funding vehicle, which backed \u201cteal\u201d MPs like Ryan to win Kooyong, tweeted a gif of an animal eating popcorn in response to the latest Frydenberg news.Another Liberal MP said they would like to see former Liberal MP Katie Allen, the endorsed candidate for the seat of Higgins, get another chance at running, potentially in Kooyong. Allen lost Higgins to Labor MP Michelle Ananda-Rajah in 2022, but large parts of Higgins have been redistributed into Kooyong.Former cabinet minister Karen Andrews, who will retire at the next election, told Nine newspapers Frydenberg was \u201csomeone we need to bring back into the Liberal Party and into federal politics\u201d, adding the party had an \u201copportunity to revisit\u201d the situation.Frydenberg, Hamer and Allen were contacted for comment, as was the Victorian Liberal party.skip past newsletter promotionOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Several claimed it would be \u201cunprecedented\u201d to reopen nominations, and feared voters would punish the party if it did so.One MP said some in the party were displeased at constant speculation about Frydenberg\u2019s political future, saying it was unhelpful to Liberal prospects. Frydenberg has not commented publicly on his future political ambitions, but MPs told Guardian Australia he has not ruled out running again.But other MPs backed the idea of reopening preselections if Frydenberg did change his mind after the redistribution. One Coalition MP, from outside Victoria, said they believed Kooyong voters may support Frydenberg more strongly as the candidate, considering his status as a potential future Liberal leader or senior minister.That MP said the Liberals needed to \u201cget serious\u201d about winning government, and that recruiting Frydenberg and winning seats like Kooyong would be crucial in that quest."}

Rob inspired the entire country with his brave battle against motor neurone disease since his diagnosis.\u201cHe passed away peacefully at Pinderfields Hospital near his home surrounded by his loving family after becoming ill earlier this week. On behalf of the Burrow family, we would like to thank the staff for their compassion and caring for Rob in his final days.\u201dThe Burrow family added in their own statement: \u201cThe outpouring of love and support that Rob and the whole Burrow family have received over the last four and a half years meant so much to Rob. In particular, the rugby league family and the MND community have rallied around Rob to inspire him, thank you for your support.\u201cFor those who knew Rob throughout his life, his determination and spirit in the face of MND over the last four and a half years came as no surprise. Rob never accepted that he couldn\u2019t do something, he just found his own way of doing it better than anyone else. He will continue to inspire us all every day. In a world full of adversity, we must dare to dream.\u201dAlongside former teammate and close friend Kevin Sinfield, the pair brought the condition into the national consciousness. After his diagnosis, Burrow and his family raised awareness plus millions of pounds for the MND community, including the foundation of the Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon in 2023.That significant fundraising also included \u00a36m to build the Rob Burrow Centre for MND in Leeds, to help support people living with the disease. The breaking of the ground on that facility was due to take place on Monday and his former club confirmed, as per Burrow\u2019s wishes, that will still go ahead as planned.After making his debut for Leeds in 2001, Burrow went on to become one of the most important players in the club\u2019s history. A member of the Rhinos\u2019 golden generation, he was instrumental in helping Leeds end their 32-year wait for a league championship with victory in the 2004 Super League Grand Final.He went on to win eight Super League titles, perhaps the most notable of which was in 2011 against St Helens when he scored what is still regarded as the greatest try in Grand Final history. He also helped Leeds win the treble in 2015 and in 2017, in his final match as a player, he helped the Rhinos defeat Castleford in the league showpiece at Old Trafford.Rob Burrow hoists aloft the Super League trophy after Leeds win the 2015 Grand Final \u2013 he won eight league titles with the club in all. Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesBurrow made 492 appearances for Leeds, placing him fifth in the club\u2019s all-time appearance list. He was capped five times by Great Britain, 15 by England and won the Challenge Cup in 2014 and 2015, as well as the World Club Challenge on three occasions. He remains one of the modern era\u2019s most decorated players.The Prince of Wales, who presented CBEs to Burrow and Sinfield in January, saluted \u201ca legend of rugby league\u201d on social media, adding: \u201cRob Burrow had a huge heart. He taught us \u2018in a world full of adversity, we must dare to dream\u2019. Catherine and I send our love to Lindsey, Jackson, Maya and Macy.\u201dLeeds opened the doors to Headingley Stadium on Sunday evening, the venue where Burrow made his name as in Super League, shortly after news of his death emerged to allow the public to pay their respects to one of rugby league\u2019s greats.Burrow former Rhinos teammate, Barrie McDermott, who has also played a part in fundraising for the MND community, said on X, formerly known as Twitter: \u201cThe world will never forget Rob Burrow. He is a hero to so many people and an inspiration to all who were lucky enough to meet him or came across his story on and off the pitch.\u201cHe was brave beyond words in those last few months, he has taught me so much about courage, kindness and love. Good night God bless my little brother I feel blessed to call you my friend.\u201dThe Motor Neurone Disease Association, for whom Burrow was a patron, said: \u201cIt is testament to the strength of feeling people have for Rob that the support in his name has never wavered.\u201cThe MND Association is incredibly grateful to Rob and his family for helping to raise awareness of MND, and funds for the Association, by sharing the details of their journey and by inspiring so many people both within the MND community and the wider public.\u201dIn a 2021 interview with the Guardian, Burrow said: \u201cI\u2019ve had such a wonderful life.

The great American cricket experiment got under way on Saturday night, when USA beat Canada by seven wickets in the opening match of the T20 World Cup at the little ground in Grand \u00adPrairie, Texas. And hell\u2019s bells if it wasn\u2019t, in its own little way, one of the game\u2019s great occasions.A crowd of around 5,000 were treated to a brilliantly free\u00adwheeling innings by USA\u2019s Aaron Jones, a pocket-rocket batsman who was born in Queens and raised in \u00adBarbados. Jones clobbered 10 sixes, one of them clean out of the ground, in an undefeated innings of 94 off just 40 balls.It was an achievement to get the match on at all. A mini tornado ripped through here last Tuesday. It took out one of the giant screens and ripped out a stretch of the heavy metal railings around the ground. There had been four days of torrential rain and flash floods since, and a lot of the surrounding towns have been without power.The small team of staff have since been working around the clock, and the entire ground is being powered by temporary generators. But in the end the only real hitch was that they could have shifted a few more tickets. The high prices meant there were a few too many empty seats.The people who did turn up enjoyed a real treat. USA were heavy favourites given that they had recently won a series against Canada 4-0, and another against \u00adBangladesh 2-1, but their bowlers seemed to be experiencing a few first-night nerves. Canada rattled off 40 runs from the opening four overs after being put in to bat. Their opener Aaron \u00adJohnson thrashed Muhammad Ali Khan\u2019s very first ball for four. He scored three more in four balls of Khan\u2019s second over, with four more in byes\u00a0off a bouncer that ricocheted off his helmet.Johnson was caught at long-off but his opening partner, Navneet \u00adDhaliwhal, pressed on.

Photograph: Matt Roberts/ICC/Getty ImagesDhaliwhal was joined by \u00adNicholas Kirton in an entertaining 62-run stand for the fourth wicket. Kirton, who has quick hands and a handsome drive, collared a couple of crisp sixes over cover. Corey Anderson had Dhaliwhal caught at long-off with the first ball he bowled. Still, Kirton went on to make 51, and Canada\u2019s total of 194 looked pretty daunting.Especially when USA were 40\u00a0for one after the first six overs, with opener Steven Taylor out lbw to the\u00a0second ball of the innings. But that only brought in Jones. He put on\u00a0131 for the third wicket with Andries Gous.skip past newsletter promotionSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week\u2019s actionPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was ferocious going, and it rattled Canada. The game turned in the 14th over, when they brought their fast bowler Jeremy Gordon back into the attack. His first two overs cost only 11, but his third was studded with three sixes, two fours, three wides, and a catch off a no ball, and went for 33. USA romped home from there.So there were a few more \u00adStetsons in the crowd, a heap more smoked brisket on sale, the stadium announcer had a southern twang, and if you looked hard enough there were one or two clues around the ground fit\u00a0for the occasion, like the\u00a0scoreboard listing the \u201cballs\u201d and \u201cstrikes\u201d hanging from the balcony, and the \u00adSpanish translations on the signage (\u201cEste Alerta!

Sometimes the games are tight and competitive but the \u00adsuperior player just wins all of the points that matter.This was not one of those matches. Across only 40 minutes, Swiatek destroyed the 41st-best female tennis player in the world. It was the \u00adshortest completed match of Swiatek\u2019s career and Potapova won only 10 points. The Russian did not contest a deuce game and the closest she came to winning a game was at 30-30 in the second game. It was about as dominant a win as can be seen at grand-slam level.\u201cComfortable,\u201d Swiatek said, describing what it feels like to be in the zone. \u201cYou just go with it because there\u2019s no point of \u00adchanging anything. You just continue what you\u2019ve been doing and what has been working. But, honestly, I was always focusing on the next point. I didn\u2019t really look at what happened before. So that was probably also why I could be efficient.\u201dThis is the fourth consecutive year that Swiatek has inflicted a double bagel on an opponent during the clay season and the second 6-0, 6-0 scoreline of her career at Roland Garros.

I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting 40 minutes [but] it didn\u2019t really affect much because I kind of knew. We planned for it.\u201dAs Swiatek continued her search for a third consecutive French Open title, she was joined in the \u00adquarter\u2011finals by the best of the best as all of the top eight seeds in the top half went through. She will next face Marketa Vondrousova, the Wimbledon champion and fifth seed, who defeated Olga Danilovic 6-4, 6-2. Gauff, the third seed, also won comfortably, beating Elisabetta Cocciaretto 6-1, 6-2, and she will face a resurgent Ons Jabeur, seeded eighth, who defeated Clara Tauson 6-4, 6-4.In the men\u2019s draw the third seed, Carlos Alcaraz, continued to build form and confidence as he easily beat F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime, the 21st seed, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 to reach the quarter-finals.

The Spaniard leads the head-to-head 5-0 and he has \u00adsmothered Tsitsipas with drop shots in most of their matches, with the Greek so often unable to read them.

One of a different kind of seeding and growth, and of a sport that has literally made the earth move, across two continents and 11,000 miles, to make this event happen.When the opening batter takes guard in New York on Monday as Sri\u00a0Lanka play South Africa in the first competitive game at the venue, he will be standing on a drop-in pitch that started its life more then eight months ago in the South Australia city of Adelaide.From there it travelled via the port of Savannah, Georgia to Boynton Beach in Florida, where the grass was sown and nurtured. At the end of April it was lifted back on to a lorry for the 1,000-mile journey to the new, temporary Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, where it and three others slotted seamlessly into the holes created for\u00a0them.\u201cSince then we\u2019ve just allowed it to grow in, given it time to adjust to the natural conditions it\u2019s facing,\u201d says Damian Hough, who has overseen the project. \u201cGiven it time to acclimatise. It\u2019s a living and breathing thing and it\u2019s gone through quite a stressful process. It\u2019s no different to humans, really:\u00a0there\u2019s a stress period and you need to give it time to adjust and recover.\u201dHough is head curator \u2013 ie groundsman \u2013 at Adelaide Oval, where drop-in pitches have been used since 2013, giving him precisely the expertise the International Cricket Council was looking for when it embarked on this project. The alternative \u2013 using the ground in Long Island\u2019s Eisenhower Park, where the stadium has been constructed \u2013 was never feasible.\u201cIt\u2019s just parkland. It wasn\u2019t fit for world-class international cricket,\u201d Hough says. \u201cThe space was flat but it was a natural field, with a loam instead of a sandy profile. To get it to an international cricket standard they needed to add drainage and a sand profile and irrigation and a new variety of turf on top. It\u2019s amazing how quickly they were able to pull it off, among the challenges that the weather has thrown at them.\u201dThe temporary stands of the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium. Photograph: Bruce Bennett/Getty ImagesThe \u201cthey\u201d Hough is referring to is LandTek, a local company specialising in sports facilities, with which he was paired by the ICC. The steel trays that the pitch has grown and been transported in were made in Adelaide but by the time they were filled they were in Florida, and his usual materials were unavailable. So he was forced to turn to the unfamiliar: soil designed for use in baseball mounds, a variety of Bermuda grass known as Tahoma 31 for the pitches, and Kentucky Bluegrass for the outfield. Hough had never used these things before. Then he had to wait and hope.\u201cYou have checkpoints at certain times where you measure, say, the root depth, and you know what you\u2019re trying to get,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve exceeded it every step of the way. Our root depth is a lot deeper than what we could do back home, we haven\u2019t been able to drive root growth the way they do over here.\u201cIt\u2019s the climate in Florida \u2013 it\u2019s an unbelievable part of the world to grow grass. So everything along the way has just been: \u2018Jeez, that\u2019s gone well.\u2019 Hopefully that correlates into really good cricket and really good pitches. There\u2019ve been challenges, curveballs thrown along the way that you have to adjust to.

We know our rotations, what games are going to be played on what pitches,\u201d Hough says. \u201cBut to me all of the pitches are equal.\u201dAll that remains is to watch the first ball go down and see how the pitches play. \u201cAs we get close to the tournament I\u2019ve constantly got a little bit of anxiety there, because it\u2019s something we\u2019ve never done,\u201d Hough says. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve thought through the processes, you know you\u2019re happy with the way it\u2019s come together. So theoretically, it should play well.\u201cBut at the same time, until you have those games you\u2019re not sure because the pitch is only five months old \u2013 it\u2019s a short period of time to build a cricket pitch and play on it. As long as they\u2019re consistent, as long as the outfield plays well and it\u2019s not too slow, that\u2019s what we\u2019re after.

On the interchange bench, he\u2019ll scream at the runner; \u201cGet me on!\u201d When he calls for the ball, you\u2019ll hear the slap of his hands; \u201cHere!\u201d Mostly it\u2019s an unintelligible but unarguable demand. He roars, they give, and then he strikes.Off the field however, we\u2019ve never really heard much from Dustin Martin. He\u2019s never let us in. In Konrad Marshall\u2019s books chronicling Richmond\u2019s premierships, he was a mostly silent presence. Those who love him \u2013 his family, his junior coaches, his mentors and his teammates \u2013 always mention his shyness. In interviews, the impression has always been of a man looking for exits.As he approaches his 300th game, and rumours over his playing future swirl, that reticence is increasingly newsworthy. As per the AFL and AFLPA\u2019s collective bargaining agreement, there is pressure on him to do a press conference, to feed the chooks, to give us something, anything.\u201cHe has an obligation to the game,\u201d SEN boss Craig Hutchison said on his Sounding Board podcast this week. \u201cHe\u2019s part of the entertainment product. I had the same view when \u2018Buddy\u2019 retired, where he didn\u2019t pay the football public the respect it deserved. The AFL need to say \u2018hey, listen, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re comfortable or not, this is what we expect of you that week.\u2019\u201dHutchison has a business to run, bills to pay, content to fill and a long-standing frustration that our local stars aren\u2019t as verbose and accessible as the champions of the NFL and NBA. That\u2019s not to say footballers don\u2019t have interesting things to say. There\u2019s still excellent profiles, whether from journalists or increasingly from the clubs themselves. But when a footballer is wheeled out against their will, they invariably end up saying nothing. Three quarters of the population seem to speak like that now \u2013 bankers at Royal Commissions, local councillors, The Bachelor contestants and contested ball beasts. It\u2019s the murder of words, and of meaning.Compared to America, the relationship between our superstars and the media is a little more strained and conditional. There are rules. Don\u2019t criticise the opposition, your teammates, the umpires, the game plan, the media. Don\u2019t smile after losses. Don\u2019t adjust your headband. Don\u2019t speak honestly after a few beers at the best and fairest. Don\u2019t go on holiday at the end of the season. For players like Martin and Lance \u2018Buddy\u2019 Franklin, it\u2019s often easier to opt out altogether.That\u2019s not always a bad thing. Sometimes a little mystery, and a lot of silence, only adds to your appreciation of an athlete. Carlton champion Bruce Doull spoke only in emergencies. His football, teammate Brent Croswell later wrote, had \u201ca moral purity about it.\u201d His football said everything that needed to be said.On the flipside, and everything about him was on the flipside, there was Gary Ablett Snr. Gary perfected the art of saying absolutely nothing, yet still leaving the questioner open mouthed. I once saw him interviewed by Sam Newman, not a man easily impressed or awestruck. As Ablett trotted out his banalities, Newman was like a giddy schoolboy.Towards the end of his career, he started a newspaper column. He could surf the crest of a pack, prop, pivot, and slot a goal on his wrong foot with the ease of a man tying a shoelace. But he was no W.C Heinz. His column was a bust. He had one of our best sportswriters ghost-writing it, but Ablett was too guarded and too difficult to say anything remotely interesting. And every time that column was published, a little bit of the magic faded.Martin clearly isn\u2019t the player he once was. After such a good run with injuries, his body\u2019s accountants have started to redress the ledger. But he can still buckle his swash. On Saturday night, he had a full house, a game with weight, and a lot of people writing him off. His first quarter goal \u2013 the way he didn\u2019t buckle at the spine, the shrug, the rapid steps, the predatory air that he projects like no other footballer I\u2019ve seen \u2013 was a snapshot of everything that has made him great.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Australia SportGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The journalists would trundle in and he\u2019d flick them down to fine leg. Would it satisfy what Hutchison called \u201can obligation to game\u201d?Instead, whenever I watch him, I think of something Brendon Gale told Marshall in his book Yellow and Black. \u201cYou look at images of footballers and you know how they\u2019ve got that startled, panicked look? You look at Dustin\u2019s eyes in those moments and they reveal nothing. He\u2019s like a shark. Like a great white, just cruising through the water. And then he strikes.\u201dThat\u2019s the Dustin Martin I\u2019ll always remember. That\u2019s him holding up his end of the bargain.

Not by the AFL or clubs,\u201d Kennett posted on X, formerly Twitter.\u201cCompensation through mediation is no proper test of any claim unless charges admitted.\u201d"}

With certain third-round matches to be finished, the French Open organisers opted to move the uncompleted contest between Zizou Bergs and Grigor Dimitrov to Court Philippe-Chatrier before Novak Djokovic\u2019s night session match, which was scheduled to begin at 8.15pm. Unless every match finished in straight sets, it was obvious that chaos would follow.It is fair to say that those matches did not finish efficiently. The match on court, Alexander Zverev v Tallon Griekspoor, immediately descended into a dramatic five-set battle. Then Bergs forced a fourth set. Djokovic and Lorenzo Musetti entered the court at about 10.30pm, with Djokovic closing off his excellent five-set comeback victory at 3.07am, the latest finish in the history of the French Open.No other prominent sport in the world has its athletes competing in the early hours of the morning, yet tennis has managed to make it a regular occurrence. In recent years, matches have finished as late as 4.05am at the Australian Open with Andy Murray last year and 4.55am at the Mexican Open in 2022.\u201cI think it\u2019s really unhealthy,\u201d Ons Jabeur, the world No9, said. \u201cI hope Novak is recovering really well for the next one. But yeah, we are trying to push to have better scheduling. But, you know, when you have long matches sometimes you don\u2019t know. Obviously with the prime matches it is also more difficult. I feel like 8.15 is really late to start the match.\u201dAt about 1am, Casper Ruud closed off his four-set win over Tom\u00e1s Mart\u00edn Etcheverry before addressing the Court Suzanne-Lenglen crowd with a smile: \u201cI love tennis and I love Roland Garros,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if I love playing at 1am.\u201d Ruud was still going through his post-match routine and talking about it on X as Djokovic\u2019s match came to an end. For the players, the work does not stop as they leave the court.\u201cI feel like a lot of times people think you\u2019re done, but really, 3am, then you have press and then you have to shower, eat and then a lot of times people do treatments, so that\u2019s probably not going to bed until 5am at the earliest, maybe 6am, and even 7am,\u201d Coco Gauff said. \u201cI definitely think it\u2019s not healthy. It may not be fair for those who have to play late because it does ruin your schedule.\u201dCasper Ruud\u2019s match also stretched into Sunday. \u2018I love tennis but I\u2019m not sure I love playing at 1am,\u2019 he said. Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile the French Open used to receive criticism for its early finishes with no floodlights, nights at Roland Garros have now swung to completely different extremes since the roof was inaugurated on Philippe-Chatrier in 2021. In some ways, things are even worse.With the arrival of the roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier and floodlights around the grounds, the French Open initiated its controversial night session, selling the rights of one prime-time match per day to Prime Video for a hefty fee as the tournament searched for new sources of income to transform the grounds. The tournament had previously been carried entirely by France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, the free-to-air national broadcaster.Despite how the night contests have been billed as the feature match each day \u2013 and the French Tennis Federation has received significant criticism for not scheduling a single women\u2019s match in the night session so far this year \u2013 it often seems that players are in a race to avoid receiving the graveyard slot. Both Rafael Nadal and Iga Swiatek have repeatedly requested earlier matches. Carlos Alcaraz also categorically expressed his disapproval for the night session.\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to recover when you are going to go to sleep so, so late,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me it\u2019s much better to finish at 6pm, having dinner really, really well at restaurant, a good restaurant, good food. So everything is better if you finish early.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThose criticisms don\u2019t even take into account the actual conditions. At the Australian and US Opens, the nights are warm. The cold conditions in Paris, though, make the clay courts even slower, the ball barely moving through the cold air. For much of Saturday\u2019s match, Djokovic struggled to hit through Musetti\u2019s excellent defence in conditions that resembled quicksand.These night sessions are also extremely difficult for all the other people involved in the sport. Fans should not need to make such a commitment for the sake of entertainment. The ballkids, many of whom are minors, and the linespeople should be able to return to their homes at an acceptable time. After midnight, there are few transport options for anyone leaving the site.What is clear is that the scheduling committees at tournaments need to be more flexible, more willing to move matches, to impose clear limits on when matches can begin and to change start times. The ATP and WTA tours have attempted to address the issue at their own non-slam events this year, initiating new match scheduling rules that include (three-set) matches not being allowed to start after 11pm and matches at 10.30pm requiring a move to an alternate court. It remains to be seen how effective they will be.Such is the unpredictable nature of professional tennis, a day after constant delays and an early morning finish, Sunday\u2019s three-match day session was shorter than Djokovic\u2019s match alone. By 4.31pm, the planned day session schedule was complete."}

In March, kicking off what I hope will be a very long series of articles, I wrote that I was in \u201cgreat shape\u201d for a 60-year-old, with plans to make it to 100. I ran 30-40km every week, I added, on top of yoga and high-intensity interval training. In April I celebrated my \u201cfreakishly strong\u201d core; in May my \u201cremarkably youthful\u201d brain. And that\u2019s just what I put in writing. At home, I can barely pass a mirror without pulling up my shirt to admire the faint beginnings of a six-pack. When I\u2019m running and I overtake someone decades younger, I get such a bounce in my step that even I think I deserve a slap.But here\u2019s the thing: what\u2019s mostly going through my mind is not: \u201cI\u2019m amazing!\u201d but: \u201cI\u2019m amazed!\u201d For three-quarters of my life there was nothing to suggest I might ever get into shape. I don\u2019t come from a sporty family, and as for school (with its rugby, cricket, football, gymnastics, swimming, etc) I remember precisely one game that I played rather than endured: a hockey match at 14 or 15, when I was in goal and, for once, found myself blocking shot after shot instead of watching them whiz into the net. This was the only time any of my teammates looked at me with something other than sympathy or scorn.Other than that, it was afternoon after afternoon of standing around bored, or running around uncomfortably, or being yelled at by an angry adult who had once dreamed of becoming a professional athlete.Sitting my way to an early grave \u2026 Phil Daoust and his now wife, Hannah, in more decadent days. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianI\u2019m not saying I was traumatised, but I definitely wasn\u2019t inspired. Over the next three decades, vaguely aware I should do something to look after my body, I had brief flirtations with rowing, swimming, cycling and kayaking, but mostly I concentrated on eating, drinking and sitting my way into an early grave.By the late 2000s, as I wrote at the time: \u201cNot only was I clinically obese; I was in denial. I had broken a neighbour\u2019s bench just by sitting on it. My mother would nod at my stomach and ask when \u2018it\u2019 was due. One so-called friend shouted \u2018Thar he blows!\u2019 when I joined him on a beach. I told myself I just needed to lose a few pounds, and it was normal for my thighs to rub holes in my jeans.\u201d My cholesterol was far too high, and when I was on edge or miserable, the only remedy I knew was to open another bottle. And there always was another bottle. I was living in France, so even good wine was cheap \u2013 and I had a cellar.I was 45 before I made a real effort to improve my diet, 50 before I started the NHS\u2019s \u201cCouch to 5k\u201d plan and discovered that running could structure my attempt to reshape myself; and 57 before I finally gave up booze. There was a lot of slippage on the way, but in my \u2013 no, seriously? \u2013 seventh decade it feels as if I\u2019ve settled into a healthy relationship with my own body. And I think I\u2019ve learned a few things worth sharing with other late starters.\u2018To build muscle back as you age, you will have to lift weights.\u2019 Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianJust because you loathed PE, you will not necessarily hate all physical activity.This time there won\u2019t be some blowhard whistling at you, or a supposed friend who would rather die than have you on his team. Now, you can choose how hard you push yourself, how long you spend doing it, and whether or not you do it when it\u2019s raining, when you\u2019re on your period, or when you just woke up aching.That said, don\u2019t count on any kind of transcendental experience.It took me years of running before I got anything like a high.But don\u2019t write off the possibility either.Last week\u2019s yoga class was coming to an end, we were lying with our eyes closed in \u201ccorpse\u201d pose and the instructor began massaging my temples with essential oil. I felt like a cat does when you rub it behind the ears.Don\u2019t underestimate the power (and pleasure) of walking.It will shift weight (if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after), condition you for something more strenuous and give you space to think or listen to your favourite music or podcast. Although most of the world seems to have forgotten this, it will also get you places \u2013 and more reliably than any other form of transport. Your feet will never go on strike, get stuck in a jam or be held at a station while an engineer arrives to reset the emergency alarm.Start with something you may enjoy, not something that friends or experts swear is good for you.Your starter exercise does not have to provide an all-body workout or stretch your mind as well as your muscles. Your priority should be to get moving, and become comfortable with your body so you can branch out when you need to. Which you will, because \u2026Even if cardio is your thing, you can\u2019t ignore resistance work.The older we get, the more muscle we lose, making it more likely that we will \u201chave a fall\u201d \u2013 and struggle to recover from it. To build it back, you will have to lift weights, learn how to use those frightening machines in the gym, or leverage the weight of your own body with push-ups, planks, lunges and squats.Even if resistance work is your thing, you can\u2019t ignore cardio.For a long, active life you need to stretch your heart, lungs and circulation as well as your abs, glutes and traps.Phil takes a tipple, back in 2015.  Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThis world is nothing but hills!You\u2019ll just have to suck this up once you start running, cycling or even walking seriously. Living at the bottom of a long, steep slope, I\u2019m reconciled to starting most runs with a six-minute climb. There are lovely parks at the end of it, and a nature reserve, and more bloody hills.Sweating like a pig doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re unfit.Sample size of one here, so it\u2019s not exactly scientific, but I still get red and drippy as soon as my pulse is raised. If I\u2019m exercising outdoors, I\u2019m happiest in drizzle; if I\u2019m doing hot yoga, with the room at 37C, there are puddles of brine around me. Sorry, yoga-mates. But also, if we\u2019re 15 minutes in and you\u2019re not even glowing, I hate you.If you\u2019re not enjoying yourself, try to narrow down why.Is it the activity that\u2019s rubbing you up the wrong way, or the environment? If you\u2019re swimming, you may discover that you hate pools but love open water. If you\u2019re running, you may far prefer roads, the treadmill or forest trails \u2013 with or without company, or music, or a target time and pace.When you exercise matters \u2013 just not in the way that most people say it does.Maybe you work out best at 6am on an empty stomach, a few hours later when you\u2019ve had breakfast and given it time to settle, or even late at night. Whatever you choose, someone on the internet will tell you that you\u2019re doing it all wrong for maximum gains, and have the scientific studies to prove it. Tell them to get stuffed. They\u2019re talking about average or typical humans. You are you; you do you.You will rarely regret paying for an instructor or personal trainer. Gyms, however \u2026If you find a trainer or teacher that you click with, and can afford a few classes, it will do wonders for your confidence and technique. When it comes to gyms, however, investing money in a membership is no guarantee you will invest time and effort. Do not sign a long-term contract unless you are 100% sure it is right for you.If you\u2019re still working, your company may have arranged what looks like a fantastic 12-month deal with a local gym \u2013 but will you have time to use it in your lunch break, or the inclination to visit before or after work? Do you really want to be wiping your thigh-sweat off the hip adductor machine so your boss can use it after you? Come to think of it, do you even like being in a gym?You will move better if your hands are empty.skip past newsletter promotionPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifePrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You do you.\u2019  Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianIf it\u2019s hurting, stop it.A little soreness is usually fine, especially after you\u2019ve exercised. If all you have to worry about is blisters, the squishy, expensive \u201chealing\u201d plasters are worth every penny. But don\u2019t ignore anything stabbing, grinding, shooting or knee-buckling. Stop what you\u2019re doing and take at least a week off. If you feel confident about resuming without seeing a doctor, physio (etc), start slowly and be prepared to stop again.In fact, if you\u2019re hating it, stop it.Sometimes a workout just doesn\u2019t work out \u2013 you\u2019re more tired than you thought, or you can\u2019t focus, or you are unexpectedly hating every minute. Give yourself a little longer; then, if you\u2019re sure this isn\u2019t something you can push through, cut the session short and tell yourself you\u2019re making sure you\u2019re in better shape for next time. Particularly at the start, you\u2019re training your brain as much as your body. Try not to teach it that exercise is horrible.That said, the \u2018second wind\u2019 really is a thing.I often find myself struggling for the first 6km of a run, then finally hit my stride. I don\u2019t pretend to understand why.Don\u2019t expect exercise alone to fix your body.It\u2019s part of the puzzle, but how you eat and feel and sleep are equally important. Also \u2026If you\u2019ve got a monkey on your back, maybe give it a little shake every now and again to see if it will let go.All the push-ups, pilates and ping-pong in the world won\u2019t make up for a problem with drink, drugs or nicotine. I have no first-hand experience of the last two. All I know is that sometimes you can outlast what seemed like an integral part of life. In 2020, at least 40 years after my first ever alcoholic drink, I had what I hope and expect will be my last. It was the first time I\u2019d managed to give up for more than a few weeks. By the time of that final glass, I was drinking at least a bottle of wine most nights. I have no idea how I stopped this time, or why I have since felt nothing more than mild longing for a mouthful of red when I am cooking. Maybe I was just ready? Maybe it was time? My drinking was never purely about stress, but it must have helped that exercise gave me another way to cope.If you\u2019re fit enough to exercise with young people, go for it.Sure, you\u2019re old enough to be everyone\u2019s father. But no one is looking at you \u2013 not with that wrinkly skin. Or, if they are, it\u2019s because they\u2019re so impressed with your side plank. You, meanwhile, are being pushed a bit harder than you would with a bunch of over-55s.Embrace the cheerleaders, ignore the others.Someone, somewhere is aching to tell you that you\u2019re wasting your time, or even heading for a heart attack. Try to remember you\u2019re doing this for you, not for some idiot who never got over the fact that the man who popularised jogging died while \u2013 oh, my aching sides! \u2013 jogging. The last bloke who gave me some \u201cfriendly\u201d advice was about my age and looked 20 years older. He was selling flowers outside a cemetery, which I guess was some kind of message.Phil, feeling smug.

Both men were a long way from the celebrated cultural figures they would become: Stein had just started to make some money as the guitarist of New York new-wave act Blondie, the band he co-founded with singer Debbie Harry in 1974; the teenage Basquiat, unable to pay for canvases, painted graffiti on to walls, floors or any material he could lay his hands on.\u201cI knew Jean pretty well and I said, \u2018Do a painting\u2019,\u201d Stein recalls now on a video call from his apartment in New York. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain it was the first thing he ever did on a canvas, because he had been painting on cardboard. He knew I was interested in militaria, so it was army men fighting with little cannons and shooting. It was pretty monochromatic and it was on a big piece of burlap, a rough canvas, not stretched on a frame, just by itself. And he gave it to me for 200 bucks. Then I later heard that he had been telling people how much he\u2019d ripped me off for 200 bucks.\u201dA few years later, though, before Basquiat died of a drug overdose in 1988 aged 27, Stein found himself short of funds. He sold the painting for $10,000 to Diego Cortez, an art curator and co-founder of the Mudd Club, where Stein and Basquiat would hang out. I point out \u2013 probably unhelpfully \u2013 that this figure is a fraction of what it would have been worth had Stein hung on to it: the record for a Basquiat painting is Untitled from 1982, which sold for $110.5m in 2017.Debbie announced that somebody had leaned out of a truck and yelled, \u201cHey, blondie!\u201d at her and that inspired the whole thing\u201cOf course, sure,\u201d replies Stein, now 74, with a wry smile. \u201cNo, I wish I\u2019d gotten more of his work. Same with Andy [Warhol], but that\u2019s just how it is. I could have bought all his fucking Marilyns and Elvises and things like that, but I just saw it all the time, so it was like, \u2018OK\u2026\u2019\u201dStein, who has thick, platinum hair that is centre-parted in neat curtains and a tidy goatee, is full of such stories: a lifelong New Yorker, his second home for much of the 1970s seems to have been CBGB, the infamous East Village music venue that was the centre of the punk and new-wave scenes. His companions back then may have been the Ramones, William Burroughs, Lou Reed or David Bowie. Or, of course, Harry, who was Stein\u2019s romantic partner for more than a decade until the mid-80s and has now been a friend for half a century. When, during the Covid lockdowns, Stein started work on his memoir, his concern was that readers wouldn\u2019t believe all the \u201cweird-ass\u201d stories had actually happened. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of odd stuff in it,\u201d says Stein of the book, Under a Rock, which is published this week. \u201cThe big challenge for me was just making all these hundreds, thousands of little anecdotes have a flow.\u201dThere certainly are some crackers. Like the time in 1977 when Iggy Pop asked Blondie to open the 20 or so dates of his US tour. Bizarrely, Bowie had signed on to play keyboards in Iggy\u2019s band (while also travelling between performances in a limousine) and one day when he was alone with Harry he asked her: \u201cCan I fuck you?\u201d Harry, straight-faced, shot back: \u201cI don\u2019t know, can you?\u201d Iggy also showed some interest, but Harry rebuffed him, too.Stein with Debbie Harry, 1990. Photograph: Paul Natkin/WireImageDid Stein mind? \u201cNooooo,\u201d he says. \u201cDebbie told me about it at that time and it was just\u2026 I think they felt obligated. And I don\u2019t know how much Iggy hit on her because he had a girlfriend with him on the tour. So I\u2019d have to ask her about that, but Bowie certainly did.\u201dPerhaps the most surprising element of Under a Rock, though, is how clear-eyed and unromantic Stein is about New York in the 70s and 80s. The city may have been a creative hotbed in those decades, but day-to-day, it could feel like living in a car crash. Stein was in thrall to drugs in that period \u2013 first pot, then cocaine and heroin \u2013 and while he came out the other side, many of his close friends, such as Basquiat, did not. Crime was out of control: Stein was repeatedly robbed and burgled; in one harrowing scene, he describes how a man forced him and Harry into their apartment at knife-point, tied them up in different rooms and raped Harry. \u201cAll these years later and I still want to kill this person; not a good feeling,\u201d writes Stein.\u201cIt was a dangerous environment,\u201d he says. \u201cWe got attacked, all this stuff was going on for everybody. It wasn\u2019t going on uptown for the rich people so much, but we were just all living on the fringes of society down there, so it was a different situation.\u201cEverybody I knew in New York at one point or another said how terrible it was and they wanted to leave,\u201d Stein continues. \u201cBut nobody left. It was just part of the zeitgeist of the times: being miserable and put upon by the environment, which was very grim. Where we lived on the Bowery [on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side]\u2026 ahhh, you pass by now and there\u2019s a giant fucking Whole Foods across the street and the New Museum, which is this very fancy corporate art endeavour. It just makes me laugh, because it\u2019s so at odds. It\u2019s mind-boggling, all that.\u201dStein grew up across the East River, in postwar Brooklyn. His parents, Ben, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9, and Stel, who had Armenian-Romanian heritage, met at a gathering of the Communist party in New York, but Stein admits this probably sounds \u201cmore glamorous and/or terrible\u201d than it was. He was a daydreamer as a child and, after his father\u2019s death when he was 13 and some early LSD trips, he began to experience hallucinations and psychotic episodes in his late teens. He spent some weeks in institutions and, with the help of medication, the delusions diminished.Music was always all-consuming: during one mental-health low, he became obsessed with the idea that the White Album by the Beatles was a live record and the band had to recreate it every time someone played the LP on their stereo. Another seminal artist for Stein in the late 60s was Dr John, whose music combined voodoo rhythms with New Orleans blues, jazz and funk. On a visit to the UK in the early 70s, he stumbled on to the Notting Hill carnival and had his first proper exposure to reggae. \u201cI just had really diverse musical tastes,\u201d says Stein. \u201cI was always looking for new forms and trying to pull disparate elements into the music.\u201dEverybody imploded after a while in the early 80s. It was tremendous amounts of pressure. And just our own weaknessesThese magpie tendencies would eventually find an outlet with Blondie. Stein had not long graduated from New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts and was playing guitar in different bands when, in 1973, he went to a gig at the Bobern Tavern by all-girl trio the Stilettos. Harry was a brunette who worked in a hair salon in New Jersey back then. \u201cShe was super-charismatic even at that very early stage,\u201d Stein remembers. \u201cI suppose I saw what people saw later on, just very early. And she was just so fucking cute. So fucking cute: it was crazy! And on top of that, being a great singer, so it was probably a little bit of all of it.\u201dHarry, who contributes the foreword to Under a Rock, puts it this way: \u201cA few weeks later we needed a bass player and Chris and I started what became a very long music and love relationship.\u201dChris Stein photographed at home in New York by Mike McGregor for the Observer New Review, May 2024.Soon afterwards, Harry, bored at work, cut her hair short and dyed it: Blondie was born. \u201cI remember when she came home with the Twiggy haircut,\u201d says Stein. \u201cAnd some time after that, she just announced that somebody had leaned out of a truck and yelled, \u2018Hey, blondie!\u2019 at her and that inspired the whole thing. We had been seeking a name and that seemed to suddenly embody it.\u201dSuccess was far from ordained for Blondie, which consisted of Harry, Stein and a turbulent lineup of three or four others, sometimes known generically as \u201cthe guys\u201d. Their first two albums built a small following, more in the UK than the US. But it was only with the release of their third record, Parallel Lines, in 1978, which combined powerpop, new wave and disco, that the band left the underground for the mainstream. Featuring the classic tracks Hanging on the Telephone, One Way Or Another and the global hit Heart of Glass, it was the bestselling album in the UK in 1979 and went on to shift more than 20m copies worldwide.\u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody really expected anything,\u201d says Stein, of Blondie\u2019s breakthrough in the 1970s. \u201cThe New York Dolls, who were a model for many of us on the downtown scene, went out into America and were not successful. And it was several years before there was any attention from the outside. Some of the first attention we got at CBGB was from the British music press, Melody Maker and those guys coming over, very early on before we got any national American press.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe next few years were a blur, especially to Stein, whose drug use was getting out of hand. There were more high points: not least the singles Atomic, Call Me and Rapture, written by Harry and Stein, which became the first song featuring rapping to reach No 1 in the US (Basquiat has a cameo in the video, recruited after Grandmaster Flash failed to turn up). But, with the record label expecting at least an album a year, and having to support it with touring, tensions erupted in the band and, in November 1982, they disbanded. \u201cIt was hard to keep up,\u201d says Stein. \u201cThat\u2019s why everybody self-imploded after a while in the early 80s. It was tremendous amounts of pressure. And just our own weaknesses, and all the drug abuse. For me, anyway.\u201dIt was also becoming clear that Stein was ill. He had blisters all over his back and legs: he feared it might be Aids but, in 1983, he was diagnosed with pemphigus, an autoimmune disease that was eventually brought under control with steroids. Harry looked after Stein, but their relationship came under strain as they both went through rehab for drug addiction. \u201cDebbie and I had grown out of sync,\u201d he writes in Under a Rock. \u201cMaybe in part because of her going off methadone and me staying on it, maybe lots of stuff, but things ran their course and she moved out.\u201dThe band and his relationship had broken up \u2013 was it a chaotic time for Stein? \u201cI am always like the boy who stood on the burning deck,\u201d he says, referencing the 1826 poem Casabianca by Felicia Dorothea Hemans. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of chaos, I like it. But I guess, inevitably, there\u2019s parts of you that get befuddled by too much chaos. I think it took its toll, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m against.\u201dChris Stein in Atlanta, Georgia, 1979. Photograph: Tom Hill/WireImageStein is assiduous not to glamorise drug use, either in conversation or the book. In 1999, he married the actor Barbara Sicuranza and they had two daughters, Akira and Vali. Last year, Stein announced that Akira, aged 19, had died from an accidental overdose. \u201cIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever dealt with, and am dealing with,\u201d he writes in Under a Rock. \u201cI thought that I presented my own drug experiences in a negative light to our kids, but I\u2019m racked with guilt that any discussions might have been misconstrued.\u201dSince Akira\u2019s death, Stein has wondered if it is possible to change one\u2019s own path. In his memoir, he references the 1915 novel Strange Life of Ivan Osokin by Russian author PD Ouspensky, in which a magician gives Ivan the chance to correct the mistakes from his past (the idea would later inspire the film Groundhog Day). But despite the fresh start, Ivan is doomed to repeat his actions again and again, and Stein goes along with that. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it would have been easy to do anything differently,\u201d he says.Blondie reformed in 1997 and came back strongly: their single Maria went to No 1 in the UK, giving the band the distinction (alongside Michael Jackson) of having topped the charts in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. They were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Their last album was the well-regarded Pollinator in 2017, but Stein reveals that Blondie has recently finished a new record, which could be released this year. \u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d he says, \u201ca little experimental in places.\u201dStein no longer plays live with the band, and is not sure he will again. \u201cAfter 50 years and all my health issues, I live a little more sedentary now,\u201d he says. \u201cJust doing the hotels and the airplanes is hard. And I\u2019ve got a fucking heart condition and I\u2019m at the tail end of dealing with prostate cancer, so I just thought, \u2018Fuck it,\u2019 you know?\u201cMaybe I should have drunk more like Keith [Richards],\u201d he goes on. \u201cI don\u2019t fucking know how those guys do it, but more power to them.\u201dHealth problems aside, Stein lives comfortably now, splitting his time between the Manhattan apartment and a larger place in upstate New York. \u201cGod knows what\u2019s going to happen in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cWe might have to retreat to the woods.\u201d Stein still has to grind, though, and makes an income through selling the photographs he has taken since the 1970s. \u201cThe music business, there\u2019s a small percentage of people who are at the top, and then there\u2019s a vast percentage below them who are just day-to-day working schlubs,\u201d he says. \u201cWe almost got there, but I never quite see Blondie as A-list. I see it as this big cult band, anyway.\u201dStill, Blondie seem to be finding a new generation of fans: last year, the band played sets at Coachella and on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury, where the field swayed as one to Heart of Glass, conducted by Harry, now 78, in a mirrored visor and CBGB T-shirt. \u201cWe are certainly appreciated, we have a lot of credibility for being authentic,\u201d says Stein. \u201cWhereas some people who are higher up the music food chain might be construed as having sold out a little more than we did.\u201dStein laughs, \u201cAs I always say: selling out means that you got paid.\u201d"}

He was trending on Twitter. \u2018Sack Lyon. Ross ruins footy. Saints are unwatchable.\u2019 was the general theme. They had just given up two late goals and the lead. Harley Reid, with 17 touches and seven clearances, was torching them.Lyon recently compared himself to a neutered dog. When he said it, he had the mournful look of a Saint Bernard that\u2019s just had the cruellest cut. On and off the field, he can\u2019t exert the same influence he used to. Coaching has changed so much and the frustration of men like Lyon and Clarkson is obvious.They can\u2019t rule like a dictator anymore \u2013 they\u2019d lose the current generation of players within a week if they tried. And they don\u2019t have the same levers to manipulate play during a game. The 6-6-6 rule and the restricted use of runners have quelled that.Players like Scott Pendlebury who double as on-field coaches are worth their weight in gold. Coaches need what Mark Thompson used to call \u201cmini versions of me\u201d and there\u2019s not many of those at St Kilda.But as Lyon says, it\u2019s easier to destruct than to create, and there\u2019s still a place for an old-fashioned clampdown. He has a history with taggers. Clinton Jones did a job for him every week at St Kilda, and Ryan Crowley used highly unorthodox methods to drive opposition midfielders nuts for years at Fremantle.\u201cReid lit \u2018em up, so we\u2019ll put time into him,\u201d Lyon said. This was no \u201ccooler\u201d. Marcus Windhager parked himself in Reid\u2019s back pocket for an hour, blanketed him, frustrated him, humbled him, and helped deliver a desperately needed four points.Harley Reid is already a considerable presence on the football field. He throws his weight around and shows no respect for his opposition elders. \u201cConfidence and cheek,\u201d he calls it.Superstar juniors often get a rude shock at the senior level. They get found out and worked over. But in less than a dozen games, Reid has been standing over and running away from champions, from North Smith medallists, and from 300 game players.That confidence, that cheek, and that raw power was personified in one passage of play a fortnight ago when he streamed away, his head high, his tongue hanging out, from Melbourne midfielder Christian Petracca. The extravagance of his bouncing technique, at full speed, with one of the best footballers of his generation chasing, was quite a sight. It\u2019s why the Eagles, who were playing park level footy not long ago, are now one of the must-watches each weekend. Whenever Reid gets the ball, the boos at Optus Stadium turn into a low-level squeal.This is a young player who\u2019s been feted all throughout his junior career, who has clubs offering $2m deals, and who\u2019s been built up in the Perth press like no-one since Ben Cousins.But he was brought down a peg or two on the weekend. He had just three touches in the second half. He gave away four free kicks, including a downfield free that gifted St Kilda the sealer. Harassed and teetering on petulant, he probably cost himself the Rising Star award when he slung Darcy Wilson to the turf.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Australia SportGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After all, both Toby Greene and Dustin Martin were ineligible for the award and they\u2019ve turned out ok. But he has a target on his back now.Lyon\u2019s Saints, as always, did it the hard way. As always, the effort was there. The first quarter aside, it was an entertaining contest. They won it with Windhager\u2019s tag, with Mason Wood\u2019s tank, and with Jack Steele\u2019s 15 tackles. But it threw up all the usual question marks \u2013 the lack of stars and forward potency and most glaringly, the plain midfield.This round showcased some extraordinary midfield talent \u2013 Nick Daicos\u2019 opening, Reid\u2019s second term, Patrick Cripps\u2019 five-minute burst and Marcus Bontempelli\u2019s entire game. But Lyon doesn\u2019t have anywhere near that level of talent. After his midfield had been trounced by GWS\u2019s Josh Kelly, Tom Green and co in last year\u2019s elimination final, he lamented the lack of stars. \u201cI can\u2019t just head to Woolworths on Glenhuntly Rd and buy one,\u201d he said.Lyon still has a few tricks up his sleeve, as he demonstrated at half-time. But the most important levers at a footy club are beyond a coach these days. They\u2019re in recruiting, in list management, and in attracting free agents, areas where St Kilda has not excelled for a long time. It\u2019s why, in interviews, Lyon oscillates between the droll, the doleful and the neutered, a man who can still win the battle, but who\u2019s losing the war."}

About 35,000 under-50s are now developing cancer every year, almost 100 young women and men a day, the research reveals.Meanwhile, there is mounting concern that a global epidemic of cancer among young people may be emerging. The explosion in cases was a key focus of discussion this weekend at the world\u2019s largest cancer conference, the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).Experts are still in the early stages of understanding the reasons behind the rise in cases. But most believe poor diets, physical inactivity and obesity are likely to be among the factors behind the surge in cancer rates among young people in the UK.Incidence rates have grown among all ages in the last two decades. But the 24% increase among the under-50s is much higher than the rises seen among other age groups.Prof Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK\u2019s chief clinician, said: \u201cOver recent decades, there has been a clear increase in cancer incidence rates in young adults in the UK. Evidence suggests that more adults under 50 may be getting cancer than ever before.\u201dThe second biggest rise in cases was among the under-25s. Their rate increased 16%, from 16.6 cases per 100,000 in 1995 to 19.2 in 2019.Bar chartThe overall incidence rate of cancer cases across all ages grew from 539 per 100,000 people in 1995 to 611.5 in 2019, according to the Cancer Research UK analysis. That represents an uptick of 13% \u2013 almost half the growth rate among the under-50s.In those aged 50 to 74, the incidence rate climbed 14%, from 955.1 to 1,092. In the over-75s there was a 10% rise, from 2,259.7 cases per 100,000 people to 2,482.7 cases. It means the rate rise in the under-50s was more than double that of the over-75s.Early onset cancers are still uncommon. About 90% of all cancers affect people over the age of 50.But the trend was still \u201cworrying\u201d, Swanton said, with 34,945 cases in 2019, according to the analysis. That total is up 34% from 26,176 in 1995. The reason the percentage change is greater than the 24% rate rise is likely because of population growth.\u201cAlthough these cases are a small proportion of the overall population and still relatively uncommon, the trend is important, and it requires further investigation,\u201d said Swanton.Researchers are still in the early stages of working out why cancer may be becoming a young person\u2019s disease, but clues are already emerging, he said.\u201cIncreased exposure to known as well as unknown cancer risk factors, changes to lifestyles and diets over time, and rising obesity may all contribute to the uptick in early-onset cancer.\u201d Swanton said.Britain has one of the highest obesity rates in Europe, with two in three adults in the UK overweight or obese.\u201cGenetics, improvements in diagnosis and screening and the microbiome could also play a role,\u201d said Swanton. \u201cWe are seeing them through our clinics and it is disturbing and we don\u2019t have a good answer as to why this is happening. It really is a scientific conundrum that urgently needs to be solved.\u201dThe surge in early onset cases is a global problem. The number of under-50s affected worldwide has rocketed by almost 80%, the Guardian reported last year.A recent review of registry records from 44 countries found the incidence of early onset cancers was rising rapidly for bowel and 13 other types, many of which affect the digestive system.Dr Aparna Parikh, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard medical school and an oncologist at Massachusetts general hospital, is part of Team Prospect, an international research group funded by Cancer Research UK that is studying the spike in cases.Speaking at the ASCO conference, she said: \u201cWe want to gain a deep mechanistic understanding of biological processes and environmental causes, and to do this we\u2019re looking at a diverse set of data and patients from all around the world.\u201dThe boom in cases was complex, Parikh said, but added that it was likely to be \u201cdriven by various factors, including diet, the environment, and features of the microbiome\u201d.One study presented at the ASCO meeting added to evidence that poor diets were contributing to rising cases of bowel cancer among the under-50s.Ohio State University said the balance of bacteria and inflammation in the gut, both of which are affected by what people eat, could cause \u201caccelerated ageing\u201d in the colon.Swanton said that while researchers raced to unlock more answers, there were multiple ways people could reduce their risk.\u201cAround four in 10 cancer cases are preventable, and there are steps people can take to help reduce their cancer risk,\u201d he said. \u201cNot smoking, keeping a healthy weight, being safe in the sun and cutting down on alcohol all makes a big difference.\u201d"}

This idiot, depicted with many others, including a Feasting Fool, a Preaching Fool and a Procrastinating Fool, was a warning to the wise by the German author Sebastian Brandt 530 years ago.Now research at a London university has unearthed a rare English 1509 copy of this book once owned by the renowned English philosopher Jeremy Bentham. And the 1494 satirical allegory, which pokes fun at various kinds of public folly, sheds new light on Bentham\u2019s influential ethics.It also makes it clear that Bentham himself was not the sort of fool to ignore his own books, since he has left revealing notes and formulas inked in the margins of several pages.Bentham, the father of utilitarianism, is the man who established the principle that the best actions are those that create \u201cthe greatest good for the greatest possible number\u201d. He remains the presiding academic muse at University College London, set up by admirers in 1826 to honour his intellect and academic approach. Bentham\u2019s ethics were also later an inspiration to liberal theorists such as John Stuart Mill.Last month, UCL academics unveiled the most significant rediscovered books left to the university in Bentham\u2019s will, including the translation of Brandt\u2019s Ship of Fools and a maths textbook explaining Euclid\u2019s propositions. Their contents, together with the philosopher\u2019s own notes, indicate how some of his radical \u00adtheories were first sparked.Bentham\u2019s famous formulas for good governance now seem like a response to both the idiocy depicted in Ship of Fools and the mathematical clarity of Euclid. Dr Tim Causer, principal research fellow at UCL\u2019s Bentham Project, believes the books show that\u00a0the philosopher\u2019s repu\u00adtation as\u00a0a\u00a0\u201ccold calculator\u201d is undeserved.\u201cHe had a well-developed sense of humour,\u201d said Causer, whose team is working on a new definitive edition of Bentham\u2019s collected works. \u201cFrom his correspondence, you can see he had a dry wit and a sarcastic turn of phrase.\u201dBut Bentham\u2019s love of sums is just as evident: \u201cThere\u2019s a mathematical sense to a lot of what he does, and this collection is a real window into the intellectual and cultural world of one of the world\u2019s great thinkers.\u201dRare books from a priceless collection owned by Jeremy Bentham have been found in UCL\u2019s libraries and archives.  Photograph: Linda Nylind/The ObserverCritical margin notes under one of Euclid\u2019s geometrical propositions are in Bentham\u2019s handwriting. \u201cThe truth of this assertion of the commentators is not so obvious,\u201d a jotting suggests.Also in the bequest is a rare copy of the last volume of The Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande by Raphael Holinshed (1577) \u2013 the text used by Shakespeare as a source for his history plays \u2013 and another history, The Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Famelies of Lancastre and Yorke by Richard Grafton (1548).Masters student Isabel Evans from California, studying library and information at UCL, has identified what she thinks is Bentham\u2019s signature on the frontispiece of this huge volume. \u201cWe are still verifying some of the handwriting,\u201d she said last week, \u201cbut you can just see that it has been crossed out later.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionEvans\u2019s detective work was prompted by a chance conversation when Causer learned from a colleague of the extent of the gifts made to the university after Bentham\u2019s death in 1832. Causer realised many of the valuable titles had gone astray.\u201cIt is really exciting. There are still slips of paper in some pages that Bentham put there 200 years ago,\u201d said the university\u2019s head of rare books, Erika Delbecque, who is overseeing Evans\u2019s work. \u201cIt is a hugely significant because Bentham is so closely related to the history of the university.\u201dCauser is confident more of Bentham\u2019s books could be tracked down with further research funding: \u201cA long-term aim is to digitise the books and make them available as a virtual Bentham library, but in the first instance we are trying to find out where they are. Some of the books date back to the 15th and 16th centuries. They are really important works and are priceless.\u201dBentham\u2019s last will and testament also infamously included the highly unusual stipulation that his body be publicly dissected and preserved as an \u201cauto-icon\u201d. In keeping with the dead man\u2019s wishes, his skeleton, dressed in his own clothes and topped with a wax head, is still on display in the UCL student centre."}

Any actuary would tell you I\u2019m well over halfway, plus the years 30-40 were one long, undignified, slightly premature MLC (I won\u2019t apologise for abbreviating; time is short \u2013 see first point) that I refuse to revisit. But I\u2019m interested in that moment when mortality ceases to be a vague, polite murmur and becomes a screaming alarm. My cohort is now traversing Dante\u2019s dark wood, so I feel surrounded if not by midlife crises (I\u2019m experiencing disappointingly few vicarious ones), then by culture exploring them.Of course, each generation rediscovers and makes a fuss about universal experiences, but it feels like the MLC is in the midst of a makeover. First, it\u2019s female. The new MLC queen is Miranda July, whose new novel All Fours is reframing perimenopausal turmoil as urgent, sensual, even \u201chot\u201d. July has managed to make midlife angst feel fresh, but positing All Fours as a singular overdue examination of the crystallising, life-upturning effect of the end of fertility is a bit unfair to many who came before. What about Bridget Christie\u2019s brilliant menopause sitcom The Change, for a start? I also think you don\u2019t need to explicitly articulate the physical and emotional reckonings of perimenopause to create art informed by it. Rachel Cusk has been dissecting aspects of female midlife turmoil since her divorce memoir Aftermath, surely; Fleishman Is In Trouble is, in large part, a female MLC novel, and Deborah Levy\u2019s extraordinary Living trilogy became a lodestar for a generation of women navigating the shifting sands of middle age (I solemnly gave it to my sister for her 39th birthday, as if transmitting a sacred text).Regardless, the female midlife crisis is having a moment. The menopause/MLC intersection has been comprehensively memeified recently (at least according to my algorithm) and new online mag, Jenny, launched in January offering a buffet of compellingly messy midlife content (dating younger men, getting 10 tattoos, taking Ozempic and more). The sports car and affair with a personal trainer are out; creative flowering, new ways of living and sexual rumspringa are in. That\u2019s welcome and yes, overdue. But there are other MLC 2024 elements that are generational and situational, not gendered.As New York magazine explored recently (perfectly illustrated with a piece of avocado toast sitting up in a coffin), millennials are hitting their 40s and their experience is very much not your mama\u2019s midlife. Traditionally \u201ca midlife crisis was born out of a complacent sense of security\u201d; now, many midlifers haven\u2019t been able to acquire the previous generation\u2019s signifiers of stability: home, job security, pension, possibly kids. On the contrary, they face \u201ca distinct lack of comfort, of resources\u201d. A midlife crisis? In this economy?Then there are the existential challenges of life in 2024. Every day, I read at least one headline that scares me silly and I don\u2019t need to enumerate them to any Guardian reader. Are we even going to get the lifespan we thought we could expect? When you\u2019re living through paroxysm after paroxysm of a polycrisis, indulging in the midlife variety could feel a little surplus to requirements. Who on earth, in 2024, feels that the rest of their life is so comfortably, predictably mapped out that they\u2019re compelled to kick against it?That suggests the MLC might be becoming irrelevant, but actually, I think it might be becoming more radical. A generation reaching midlife without the security it was promised is questioning, even wondering how to dismantle, the systems and structures that failed to deliver. I\u2019m not hearing about old school midlife drama from friends, but I am hearing plenty from people sick of unfulfilling and unstable work, profound inequities and inaccessible housing, childcare and healthcare. They aren\u2019t questioning their individual life choices so much as the way these have been curtailed and threatened, the paucity of political alternatives on offer and how all of that could \u2013 and must \u2013 change.Conventionally, midlife crises ended in a sheepish realisation of how much you could lose by setting fire to your life, a renewed appreciation for comfort, possibly a settling into caution and conservatism. At least in a world already on fire, there\u2019s little chance of that happening. Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The offspring could then be crossed back into the original breed.\u201cThe reality is it doesn\u2019t take many crossbreeds before you get back to a dog which looks like the original,\u201d Rusbridge said.She is adamant the approach does not mean doing away with beloved dog breeds, or creating designer pooches. Instead, the idea is to save them. \u201cReboot the breed,\u201d she said.Crucially, Rusbridge added, such efforts must involve the formation of crossbreed registries, and a route by which later generations can be registered as pedigree members of the original breed.The approach has already been adopted in several Nordic countries, with Finland launching separate outcrossing projects for the cavalier King Charles spaniel and the French bulldog.\u201cAltogether, there have been or are ongoing at the moment over 10 official cross breeding projects in Finland,\u201d said Kaisa Gold, secretary of the scientific committee of the Finnish Kennel Club.Lena Gillstedt, a breeder involved in an outcrossing project run by the Swedish Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club, said: \u201cOf course, there are some breeders who are sceptical and even negative. But overall, the consensus among breeders has been very high.\u201dShe added that so far six litters had been born and more were on the way.But not everyone is convinced.Michael Levy, chair of the UK-based Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club, said although the organisation watched such efforts with interest, they \u201ccurrently do not see this as a solution to some of the health issues we face with our popular breed\u201d.He added: \u201cAs with any breeding, selection is of the utmost importance and health is the priority always in those selections. Health testing is conducted and encouraged by all the breed clubs.\u201dHe said his club strongly advocated that breeders DNA test their dogs for MMVD, while a new scheme would start soon to reduce the prevalence of syringomyelia.The UK Kennel Club said it had accepted outcrossing projects, similar to those in Finland, for various breeds over the years \u2013 although none have included French bulldogs or cavalier King Charles spaniels \u2013 and had a pathway back to pedigree status.But Dr Joanna Ilska, genetics research manager at the Kennel Club, said there must be robust evidence and a plan in place to maximise the chances of outcrossing improving health and ensure improvements were successfully spread through the breed.\u201cWe continue to urge breeders to participate in health screening their dogs prior to deciding to breed and the Kennel Club has developed a number of tools to not only help breeders make responsible decisions, but also to collect data, which is vital for future actions and solutions to protect dog health,\u201d she said.Rusbridge said a more proactive approach was needed, noting that at present it is up to breed clubs to push for outcrossing projects with the Kennel Club. \u201cAttitudes across the board need to change,\u201d she said."}

The dad with his household order on a scrappy sliver of paper. The girl of 11 or 12 quietly reciting her own family\u2019s demands, lips miming through lyrics of Mum\u2019s mushy peas and little brother\u2019s Vimto. Teenagers documenting the seconds that passed on mobile phones. They argued over whether gravy on chips was disgusting or not without looking up from their screens. A man of 60 or so joined us, rubbed his hands together and addressed my mum: \u201cYou can\u2019t beat Chippy Night can you, love?\u201d For a few splendid minutes, the democracy of the chip-shop queue made everything seem all right.Mum agreed with the man. It was she who declared this was our Chippy Night, an electric phrase that still, in my early 40s, elicits a cry of \u201cGet in!\u201d and a cheer from my teenage daughter. All three of us were there now, outside the Fisherman\u2019s Wife in York, our nostrils tickled by the smell of batter and vinegar, our eyes drawn to the cosy glow of a fish and chip shop on a dark night. Among the closed shops and curtained windows of Bishopthorpe Road, it gleamed like a gold tooth in a barren mouth.In order to read the blackboard menu inside, Mum was on her tip-toes now, peeking over a veil of window condensation. I looked at her and realised that I had grown up with this comforting ritual for most of my life. Later, as we emerged from the doorway, my daughter asked if she could carry our bundles of fish and chips home, warming herself on them as she had done since she could walk. Next came the familiar request: \u201cCan I try a chip now, just to check them?\u201dThis most spartan, unfussy and unchanged of meals, and the habit of lining up outside its neon houses, had become a golden-battered thread between all three of us. At times, even the ghost of my grandad comes along, materialising briefly in the stories Mum would repeat about him. \u201cHe\u2019d always go in and ask if they left the skin on their fish,\u201d she\u2019d recall. \u201cThen call them \u2018Dirty bastards\u2019 if they did.\u201d\u2018Fish and chips have the soft power to bind us together\u2019: Daniel and daughter Kaitlyn are joined by the cat. Photograph: Courtesy of Daniel GrayWe are not alone in this continuity. It is what fish and chips do. Every person in that queue probably had their own stories, memories, habits and connections. If they didn\u2019t, then they were making them now. At different times as we waited, all of us peered through the condensation at what was happening inside. It transported me backwards, hurtling through time, to an age younger than my daughter is now. There I was, 12 years old, with my friend Richard beside me, both of us watching what looked like bleary ghosts bobbing around inside the chip shop. Queueing up after our visits to the swimming baths, a seductive aroma would drift out from the shop each time the door opened, a movement which also set free the melodic refrain of a chip lifter tinkling against the frying range. Once inside, we\u2019d see that our bobbing ghosts were the white-coated women who worked behind the counter. Then, we\u2019d await the heavenly call of \u201cWho\u2019s next, please?\u201d, a sound even sweeter than a fire alarm during double chemistry.Perhaps the fact that I find such comfort and calm in fish and chip shops was inevitable \u2013 and even biological. Their very existence is tethered to mine. Just over a century ago my great-grandma, working in the family chippy in Wetherby, and my great-grandad, queueing for his tea, locked eyes for the first time. Courting followed and then came marriage, I hope with scraps thrown as confetti.Running chip shops \u2013 or \u201cfish shops\u201d as they, West Yorkshire folk, would call them \u2013 became something of a family trade. For not much outlay, owning one offered a ladder to relative riches for people who usually hacked coal for a living.Sitting in her chair, a myna bird in the cage beside her, my great-grandma would later tell of her days at the frying range, powered by coal and then newspaper when that ran out. In her 90s by the 1990s, she talked about chip-shop prices between the wars and how their business sold nothing but the basics \u2013 mushy peas came later, a flashy extravagance. This was Yorkshire, after all.Eventually, family shops were sold and ours became a story from the other side of the range \u2013 that of Chippy Night and childhood enchantment. We are eaters, not makers.\u2018Can I try\u00a0a chip now,\u00a0just to check\u00a0them?\u2019 asks\u00a0my daughter\u00a0going homeThrough separate stages of life flow different chip-shop traditions. When we three queue now, we are blissfully partaking in the latest rituals. Who knows, one day I may queue with my own grandchildren and bamboozle them with the very concept of drinking dandelion and burdock. Chip shops grant that sense of the unchanging and the concrete \u2013 of the being sure of something \u2013 that is central to feeling anchored. Each one is also pleasingly different to the next, a deep-fried republic, something revitalising in a country of unvarying high streets. This much is symbolised in the regional variations offered across the land: Wolverhampton\u2019s orange chips, Hull\u2019s chip spice, Cumbrian patties. They are tiny, shimmering and gurgling societies of their own, focal to the communities that surround them. They are also an endangered species.Our chippies have faced desperate times before, but none so difficult as these. In 2022, such was the saddening and alarming rate at which they were closing, the National Federation of Fish Friers warned of \u201cpotentially an extinction event\u201d. Sarson\u2019s, the vinegar manufacturer, predicted that half the UK\u2019s 10,500 chip shops would be gone by 2025. This has always been a backbreaking trade of long hours, but in recent times external, uncontrollable factors have worsened the load.Last year, a combination of post-Brexit supply-chain difficulties, a shortage of cheap raw materials resulting from the war in Ukraine and severe energy cost rises made running a chip shop an arduous undertaking. More recently, the UK\u2019s relentlessly wet autumn and winter greatly damaged the potato crop, meaning what has survived will cost owners more. Oil prices continue to rise, too.For customers, the central repercussion is a stark increase in the price of this traditionally affordable treat. Even takeaway fish and chips has, in many places, climbed above the psychologically sacrosanct \u00a310 barrier. Perhaps we need to stop thinking of this as a cheap and cheerful meal. All the same, a tenner for something so gladdening, tasty and filling does represent good value. Especially, that is, if you do as my family has always done and reheat leftover chips for butties the next day.\u2018Mushy peas came later, a flashy extravagance\u2019: Daniel Gray and daughter Kaitlyn in 2017. Photograph: Courtesy of Daniel GrayThere may be some who see this demise as an inevitable, irreversible trend and even a consequence of market forces. As a nation, our tastes have broadened and there have never been so many alternative genres of cuisine. Yet this dish still matters, too, offering something shared, something so many of us love now or associate with fond memories. Fish and chips have the soft power to bind many of us together, even if it is just for a two-minute conversation about vinegar or pickled onions as we queue.With the same adherence to simple, quality ingredients, and with their usual resilience, fish and chip shops can and will survive. The burden is more on us, as customers, to join the queue and stumble upon new traditions.Back when I was 12, my friend and I would emerge from the ghosts\u2019 chippy with paper bales of the good stuff. Chip heat reanimated our cold and chlorine-crimped fingers. Batter flew smoke signals into the dank evening, steam-drying our uncombed and sodden hair. We ambled cautiously onwards, scoffing ravenously, but guarding our packages. Eating outside extinguished etiquette. Under the sky, we could talk with our mouths full and pincer our food with eager fingers. Wooden forks were plunged into a plump chip and left dormant, tiny Excalibur swords welded into Maris Pipers.Further traditions followed. There was the chip shop on Essex Street, Middlesbrough, that Dad and I would visit after watching our beloved Middlesbrough FC lose again. It offered the hot glee of chips from what appeared to be the front room of a terrace house. Then, when my parents split, Mum introduced Tuesday Treat Night to cheer that dreary day \u2013 few dishes, or indeed pursuits, equalled the battered comfort of a chippy visit. In young adulthood, there was time spent with my grandma in the Wetherby Whaler, a few metres from where my great-grandma met her love, and home to smooth batter and chips with a week\u2019s worth of flavour. After I left York for Newcastle University, those familiar vinegar scents and flashing signs in my new city made it feel less far from home.\u2018Here is something calming and connecting, something shared and constant.\u2019 Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The ObserverThen, some years later, a minor parental miracle of the type that doesn\u2019t matter yet matters enormously happened. The toddler who called me \u201cDaddy\u201d loved the golden food she shared with me one afternoon while sitting on my knee in a Whitby fish and chip restaurant. Soon, we found a place to go, a local. Sitting opposite one another, her young conversation percolating, ordering from the small menu and the big one became a weekly occasion \u2013 usually after swimming, of course. Fish and chips had become our thing.Travelling across the country to research my book, in Dundee and Devon, in Bethnal Green and Blackpool and in many places besides, I learned that these were not my feelings and experiences alone. Everywhere families and friends, people falling in love and people who just wanted to get out for a bit, were revelling in their visits to chip shops and restaurants. They had their own rituals, from the outlets they visited to the way they dressed and doused their meals, and their own routines. Somehow these places, and fish and chips, belonged to them.In a health-conscious world this may seem alien, and even reprehensible. Arteries were probably harmed in the making of my book. Yet the mental health benefits of a moderate chip-shop habit are serious and many. Here is something calming and connecting, something shared and constant. Something ever-present upon a planet shuddering in chaos and flux. Whenever we see those two words separated by an ampersand lit up on some damp night, we chippy types are home, wherever we may be.Food of the Cods: How Fish & Chips Made Britain by Daniel Gray is published by HarperNorth at \u00a312.99.

We need to decolonise, says the author of a new book \u2013 but not all experts agree", "author": "Zo\u00eb Corbyn", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/02/european-colonialism-botany-of-empire-banu-subramaniam", "text": "When Banu Subramaniam thinks about whether plants should be renamed so as not to honour white supremacist colonialists \u2013 Cecil Rhodes, for example, is commemorated in the names of 126 plant species \u2013 she contrasts it with how, for so many years in our patriarchal system, women were expected to change theirs. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t considered complicated\u2026 and yet those in power give any number of reasons why this is,\u201d says the professor of women\u2019s and gender studies at Wellesley College, outside Boston, Massachusetts.Subramaniam is the author of the provocative new book, Botany of Empire. The book challenges plant science to better see the ways in which it has been profoundly shaped by European colonialism and how imperial attitudes, theories and practices endure. Colonialism and colonial logic remains \u201csedimented at every level\u201d, argues Subramaniam, who also looks at what a more widespread and serious effort to \u201cdecolonise\u201d might look like, even if such a project is never-ending. The book focuses on three subfields: taxonomy, plant reproductive biology and invasion biology (the science of the spread of introduced species).Subramaniam grew up in postcolonial India where she received a \u201ccolonial-style biological education\u201d. She gained her PhD in evolutionary biology in the US before finding feminist science and technology studies. She describes herself as an interdisciplinary scholar: \u201cThe sciences see me as having left science\u2026 I don\u2019t,\u201d she says.Samples from Kew Herbarium of three of the 126 plants named after Cecil Rhodes: from left, Crotalaria rhodesiae, Cyphostemma rhodesiae and Coptosperma rhodesiacum. Photograph: RBG KewThe book enters the fray at a contentious moment. It is the International Botanical Congress (IBC) in Madrid in July and the so-called Nomenclature Section, responsible for the International Code that governs the scientific naming of plants, will be meeting to discuss and decide on a number of amendments that taxonomists have proposed since it last met seven years ago. Included is whether a mechanism should be added to the code so plant names that are regarded as culturally offensive or inappropriate can be rejected. If it passes the preliminary voting stage, it will be over to about 200 taxonomists who have individual votes along with the power to cast secret votes for their institutions.Think of how useful plant taxonomy was to the colonial project, says Subramaniam. The impulse to create a universal plant nomenclature was necessary for empire because it gave it a way of identifying and mapping its spoils. \u201c[The colonialists] wanted to know: \u2018Was the nutmeg plant here the same as this plant there?\u2019\u201d she says. In addition to the way colonialists are celebrated in plant names, colonialism endures, including in how reference specimens for species, selected when they are named, are often still housed in western herbaria, which still control botanical norms; in how \u201cparachute science\u201d, where western botanists pop into formerly colonised countries and then return home to process the specimens and publish, lives on; and even in the way our nomenclature persists (the Latin-based binomial system of naming plants with the genus followed by the species, developed by Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus in the 1700s, won out).Today we demonise non-native plants as evil and undesirable. Subramaniam worries that this is helping to fuel xenophobiaIn the case of plant reproduction, Subramaniam draws on the work of historians of science who show how European colonial sexual norms based around heterosexual romance were transposed on to plants by Linnaeus. She argues that, as a result, our vocabulary and how we think about the way plants reproduce today \u201crelies obsessively\u201d on binary categories of male/female with their limited possibilities. Into this \u201cimpoverished\u201d framework we try to shoehorn a breathtaking array of plant reproductive arrangements. More than 85% of flowering plants end up classified as \u201cbisexual\u201d or \u201chermaphrodite\u201d, because the flowers have male and female parts; and that\u2019s not to mention all the \u201casexual\u201d ways flowering plants can propagate such as through roots, stems, leaves and buds. \u201cThere are more exceptions than rules,\u201d says Subramaniam. \u201cPlants do such interesting things\u2026 if we had better ways to describe them that aren\u2019t based around human reproduction, it might open up other ways to study them.\u201d (Subramaniam has published suggestions of new terminology and vocabulary.)Meanwhile, when it comes to invasion biology, the good native/bad foreigner binary that has become so pervasive in how most people think about plants\u2019 place in the world is deeply ironic. We seem to have forgotten that it was European colonialism that ushered in the \u201cmassive and grand reshuffling of global biota\u201d that we see before us. That they are here, for good or bad, is a legacy of colonial botany. And most of our agricultural species are foreign, too, though we don\u2019t hate them on our dinner plates.The colourful bloom of the Australian bush tomato Solanum plastisexum, recently described as a model for the sexual fluidity that is present throughout the plant kingdom. Photograph: Ingo Oeland/AlamyYet today we demonise non-native plants as evil and undesirable. Subramaniam worries this is helping to fuel xenophobia and giving us poor approaches to species conservation and management. Blame the plant and attention flips to violent eradication, which rarely works. Meanwhile the real problem, landscapes disturbed through overdevelopment (for it is often here that introduced species find their chance), takes a back seat. Former colonies\u2019 promoting and protecting of native plants \u2013 essentially trying to return the environment to some kind of idyllic past state \u2013 while simultaneously showing so little regard for the Indigenous people who co-evolved with those flora and fauna, is a continuation of a colonial settler logic, suggests Subramaniam. \u201cWe need other logics for our approach to nature\u2026 not ideological litmus tests,\u201d she says.For Sandra Knapp, a taxonomist at the Natural History Museum and past president of the UK\u2019s Linnean Society, the book provides an interesting perspective on botany but she questions some of Subramaniam\u2019s characterisations.While colonialists\u2019 names do persist in plant names, it is a stretch to say the field is \u201ccelebrating\u201d those people; big herbaria aren\u2019t just confined to the global north, although there are more there; and \u201cparachute science\u201d is diminishing. One of the reasons botany used male and female when talking about plants\u2019 pollen and ovule-bearing organs is because it made common understanding easier. \u201cAs plant scientists discover more about plant reproductive biology, they realise it kind of defies categorisation,\u201d says Knapp, referring to a recent discovery about the sexual fluidity of an Australian bush tomato.But, chiefly, Knapp questions the book\u2019s starting point: that botany has its head in the sand over its colonial past. While botany isn\u2019t a monolith, from Knapp\u2019s perspective, the journey is under way: the field is actively engaged with thinking about and coming to terms with its past, as well as how it might create a more inclusive future. \u201cThere\u2019s a blossoming of this discussion throughout botany now,\u201d says Knapp. \u201cIt might not be the conversation [Subramaniam] thinks there should be, but that\u2019s all the more reason to keep it going.\u201dKnapp points to a wealth of projects taking place at institutional and grassroots levels to amplify different voices: the Linnean Society\u2019s addition to its library of portraits celebrating its first female fellows; a recent project by botanists to relay untold stories of individuals who collected and studied plants but who have been excluded from historical accounts; and work she has been undertaking with colleagues to produce a dataset of plant genera named after women.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThere are also more proposals to change the code to make things more inclusive than just the plant names suggestion. They include requiring, where possible, the herbarium where a new species reference specimen is deposited to be within its native geographical distribution; and rejigging the code\u2019s voting system to one vote per institution to establish a fairer global distribution of institutional votes (currently larger institutions \u2013 which skew to the global north \u2013 have more votes so retain more influence). Another naming proposal is to permanently and retroactively eliminate the use of root words in plants\u2019 second names that link to a particular racial slur.There are \u201cpockets\u201d of effort, acknowledges Subramanian, though whether the code will change in these ways remains to be seen. And, from a decolonisation perspective, there are lots of questions: who will be on the committee that deems what names are culturally offensive or inappropriate? What will the names be replaced with? \u201cThere are no easy projects of decolonisation\u2026 and it\u2019s going to take a long time to figure out,\u201d Subramanian says, adding that the main project must be one of botany unearthing, teaching and continually reminding itself of its history.Maybe it\u2019s time to bring this below-the-radar subject into the openMeanwhile, Subramaniam\u2019s critique of invasion biology hits the mark for some such as Ken Thompson, a retired ecologist from Sheffield University and author of the 2014 book Where Do Camels Belong? It isn\u2019t the mainstream view, notes Thompson, but that our vilification of non-native species is misplaced is something he too has long argued, to plenty of criticism. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to bring this below-the-radar subject into the open,\u201d he says. Not least, global heating means species have to move and we may need to welcome new ones. As Thompson sees things, focusing more on the function of plants rather than their origin is a better approach.Yet for Daniel Simberloff, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Tennessee, Subramaniam\u2019s arguments, which he has encountered before, remain tortuous and unconvincing, and lack evidence. Not only does she \u201calmost completely\u201d ignore the impacts of many non-native species, but there is also scant proof that judgments about the aesthetics of non-native plants transfer to xenophobia. And approaches to restoration, which involve removing non-native species, aren\u2019t so much about trying to return land to some unspoilt past but giving degraded ecosystems a fighting chance to recover. There are plenty of examples where campaigns to eradicate invasive non-native species have worked, he notes.Responding to a recent study that found invasion biology research negatively frames non-native species, regardless of whether they cause harm, Simberloff and others in the field point out that the accumulating evidence is that substantial numbers of non-native species are going on to have a harmful impact. The rule of thumb used in the past \u2013 that only 1% of non-native species can be expected to become pests \u2013 is a \u201chighly misleading low estimate\u201d (though a new estimate is hard to give). Given that it isn\u2019t always clear which non-native populations can \u201cirrupt into invasion problems\u201d, a precautionary principle, even if they seem benign, is prudent, they argue. They also point to a \u201cformidable international scientific consensus\u201d that non-native species pose threats, citing a sobering Invasive Alien Species Assessment published last September by an intergovernmental body representing 143 member countries.Subramaniam stresses it is not that non-native species can\u2019t, in some cases, go on to be real concerns. She cites kudzu in the US, water hyacinth in India, and itadori [Japanese knotweed] in the UK. But the problem is us, and we should take responsibility: most are \u201cinvited invasions\u201d and that they may become overrepresented is a symptom of our destructive ecological approach. \u201cInstead of just blaming the plant and telling the story of the invading foreigners coming to take over, let\u2019s retell it and hold human hubris to account,\u201d she says.Her takeaway message when it comes to plant science: \u201cBotany, like everything, is political. Question received wisdom.\u201d"}

A three-person cleanup crew ultimately spent six hours picking up the trash around the lake. Nevertheless, not all the trash was removed.Due to rocky beaches, high water levels and dangerous water conditions, cleanup crews will not be able to pick up the trash at the bottom of the lake \u201cuntil late next month or early July\u201d, said Carlisi.\u201cWhat was left behind in the lake could be damaging to our fish and wildlife, which is a big problem. If a deer goes down to the water and eats a plastic wrapper, that would make them sick,\u201d she added.In response to the litter, the University of Oregon issued a statement in which it apologized for its students\u2019 actions.\u201cThe garbage left behind does not represent the values of our institution. We are sorry for the impact to the island and extra work for the forest service,\u201d the statement said, KGW 8 reports.\u201cWe are investigating this event and working with the US Forest Service and our students to remediate the damage and hopefully prevent similar actions in the future. This is not a university sanctioned or sponsored event but is attended by university students, many of whom are members of university-recognized fraternities and sororities,\u201d the university added.Similarly, the University of California, Davis announced that it was investigating the incident, saying, \u201cThe university was disappointed to learn of this conduct, and is exploring ways of working with students to help restore the site or otherwise address the situation. We are still assessing information from the forest service.\u201cStudents are expected to comply with all laws, and failure to do so may result in discipline under the university policy on student conduct. Student visits to Shasta Lake over Memorial Day weekend are not sanctioned or sponsored by the university,\u201d it continued.The Guardian has reached out to the forest service for comment."}

In a few weeks, Unesco is set to announce its decision on an application to allow the Flow Country in north Scotland to become a world heritage site.Such a designation is only given to places of special cultural, historical or scientific significance and would put this remote region of perpetual dampness on the same standing as the Great Barrier Reef, the Grand Canyon and the Pyramids.The Flow Country straddles Caithness and Sutherland in the most northerly part of the British Isles and is the largest area of blanket bog in the world. Covering 4,000 sq km, it is also home to a remarkable range of wildlife that includes the black-throated diver, golden plover, greenshank, golden eagle, merlin and short-eared owl, as well as otters and water voles.The land is carpeted with sphagnum moss that covers layers of peat that can reach down to depths of 10 metres, enough to bury a double decker bus, while the local plant life includes sundews, which use their sticky tentacles to feed on insects.Short-eared owls live in the area, which is home to a 21,000-hectare RSPB reserve. Photograph: David Chapman/AlamyIt is a remarkable habitat which was the subject of a formal request made last year by a partnership including the RSPB, NatureScot and the Highland Council to have the bogs, pools, lochs and hills of the Flow Country designated a world heritage site, a place of outstanding international importance that deserves \u00adspecial protection. Unesco has said that, after more than a year\u2019s deliberation, it is ready to give its formal decision on the application in the next few weeks.\u201cThere are many other, larger areas of peatland in the world \u2013 in Siberia, for example \u2013 but blanket bog is special,\u201d said Roxane Anderson, professor of peatland science at the University of the Highlands and Islands, which is also involved in the Unesco bid. \u201cBlanket bog can cover very steep slopes, unlike other types of peatland, and can envelop the landscape in a very complex mosaic. It is also very thick, not so much a blanket as a quilt that coats the entire terrain.\u201dmap of areas in Flow Country's Unesco bidAs to the factors that sustain \u00adblanket bog, Anderson is clear. \u201cIt\u2019s the rain and the fog. If you have peat and the weather gets warm and dry, it will dry, crack and fall away in steep areas. But in the Flow Country it never gets dry or hot, so the bog here remains intact, even on sharp inclines.\u201dThe blanket bogs of Caithness and Sutherland have been growing for an astonishingly long time, since the last glaciers retreated from the north of Scotland more than 10,000 years ago. Over this time, they have played a critical role in storing carbon. The Flow Country covers a total of almost one million acres of land and stores more than 400m tonnes of carbon in its blanket bog, scientists have calculated. However, there is a downside to this mix of peatland and peace: midges. The Flow Country is rated as one of the worst places in Scotland for that eternal curse of Caledonia, Culicoides impunctatus. Midges appear as maddening clouds of biting bugs that will attack humans, livestock and pets and they thrive in the region\u2019s boggy, acidic ground which provides a perfect environment for breeding.Otters enjoy the boggy landscape of the Flow Country. Photograph: Graham Ella/AlamyThe region is also remarkable because it provides an extensive area of wild land and solitude on the other\u00adwise highly developed and densely populated British islands. This desolation was enhanced during the clearances of the 18th and 19th centuries, when many Highlanders were forcibly evicted from their homes in the wake of the failed uprising by the Jacobites. Vast tracts of the north of Scotland were depopulated as a result.Just what the Flow Country will gain if it is made a world heritage site remains to be seen, however. \u201cAt present, tourists take the North Coast 500 route, a 500-mile circuit of roads that loop round the north of Scotland completely skirting the Flow Country,\u201d said Frances Gunn, chair of the Flow Country World Heritage Project steering group. \u201cWe hope that, in future, if they see signs telling them they are passing a world heritage site, they might take a detour and visit us.\u201dSphagnum mosses thrive in the cool and wet environment of the Flow Country.

Families would set off to cut peat from land at the edge of the main part of the Flow Country. \u201cIt was a great social occasion that could last a long time, depending on the weather. For us, peat was a key source of energy. Today, we now realise that peat helps provide us with protection against \u00adclimate change.\u201dFrom her house, Gunn has a clear view of the peatlands of the Flow Country, while from the other side of her home, in Tongue, she can \u00adwitness the creation of another remarkable local project: the Sutherland Space Port which is being constructed on the nearby A\u2019 Mh\u00f2ine peninsula. In the near future, rockets fired northwards from the port, over the open seas, will carry satellites into orbits that will sweep over the poles and allow them to monitor the Earth\u00a0below.\u201cIt\u2019s a neat juxtaposition,\u201d said Gunn. \u201cOn one side, we will be working to protect the past in our neighbourhood and preserve the Flow Country. On the other, we will be launching space probes that will allow\u00a0us to survey the state of the environment in every other part of the globe.\u201d"}

Rob, by then, could no longer talk and, in his wheelchair, he could barely move. Motor neurone disease had made him a prisoner in his own body. I was anxious before we began because it seemed an impossible task. Rob,\u00a0however, had spent much of his life proving that he could overcome preconceptions.He was the rugby league giant who, despite being 5ft 5in tall and weighing a shade over 10 stone, had played almost 500 games for Leeds Rhinos, and won eight Super League championships and\u00a018 international caps.He dazzled and tackled opponents who were often double his weight and stood more than a foot taller than him.From his earliest junior years right the way through to all those grand finals, Rob had ripped up doubts that he was too small to make it. Instead, he had left a huge mark on rugby league and become one of the most cherished players in Britain.So Rob soon showed me how we might work together. He used a device called Eyegaze to answer my questions. Rob would pick out individual letters on a monitor and, by using his eyes, build words and then sentences. When he was ready to reply he would turn to me and his wife, Lindsey, with a smile. Lindsey and I knew that it was time for us to stop talking. In the sudden silence Rob would use his eyes to play a recording of his reply. It felt like magic to hear his voice, and that unvarnished Castleford accent, suddenly brought to life.All this was possible because, in the months after his diagnosis for MND, he had read a book out loud so that a computer could store his voice and recreate the words he wanted to say when he was rendered speechless for ever. Despite the gravity of his condition, Rob still made me laugh.Burrow left a huge mark on rugby league and was one of the most cherished players. Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAHe said that, even though he didn\u2019t like hearing himself, it was far better that his answers came in his own accent \u201crather than an American robot voice like Stephen Hawking\u201d.So, 16 months after he had been told he had less than two years to live, Rob and I were able to talk. It was a long, slow and exhausting process for him but he was determined to complete our interview. We had three sessions together over two weeks and, as he reflected on the meaning of his life and looming death, Rob also spent many hours using Eyegaze to email me his more complex and free\u2011flowing replies. The interview ran as an amalgam of his \u201clive\u201d answers via Eyegaze and his emailed insights.The first were much shorter, of course, but they were moving. \u201cI appreciate the simple things,\u201d Rob\u2019s voice said as it boomed out of the computer. \u201cI don\u2019t have a bucket list because I\u2019ve had such a wonderful life. However, I want to make the most of the time I have\u00a0left.\u201dIt took him almost 10 minutes to formulate that answer \u2013 which gave me an insight into how testing life had become for Rob. And then I would wake to some extraordinary emails, which amplified those thoughts, as Rob had spent so much\u00a0time on his own to add texture and depth to his replies.\u201cI have changed my opinion about living in the moment,\u201d he wrote to me late one night. \u201cSince my diagnosis I see the moment as it is and find meaning in it. When the kids are playing in the garden or purely having fun, it makes me appreciate the moment. One day, before I know it, I won\u2019t be able to enjoy these timeless moments. When I tell Lindsey and the kids I\u00a0love them, you never know how far you are from telling them that for the last time.\u201dBurrow played almost 500 games for Leeds Rhinos and won eight Super League championships. Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersRob was only 41 when he died. He and Lindsey had been together,\u00a0apart from a brief break when she was at university, since they were 15. It was an immense love story that became even more moving in the often harrowing last\u00a0year of his life. Lindsey\u2019s care for him never wavered.I have been to their home often in recent months and, as it became increasingly difficult for Rob to swallow even mashed food, Lindsey still found ways to help him. She maintained her steady source of good cheer, talking brightly or gently to Rob, even though he was too frail and exhausted to respond with much more than a \u201cYes\u201d or a \u201cNo\u201d on the Eyegaze machine.But a flickering fire still burned inside him. He wanted to live as long as possible. Rob always said that he would accept the diagnosis of MND, a disease of almost unbearable cruelty, but that he would fight the prognosis which, on that terrible day in December 2019, told him that he could only expect to live for another 18 months or, at most, two years.His wife Lindsey\u2019s care never wavered throughout a relationship which started when they were 15. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIn the end, Rob lived for more than four and a half years. In that time he won awards and he was loved and exalted even more than when he played for Leeds. But, far more importantly, he loved every day that he saw his three young children \u2013 Macy, Maya and Jackson \u2013 run across to him with such love and life. They are pretty amazing kids and it says so much for Rob, and Lindsey, that they have flourished despite their dad being in the merciless grip of MND.Lindsey messaged me last Tuesday evening to tell me that Rob had been hospitalised with pneumonia. She said she was trying to remain positive but she knew how ill he had become. It was a distressing echo of the events of last summer when she had feared that a different bout of pneumonia would hasten the end of Rob\u2019s life. But he rallied then and was able to return home.His recovery made me think of what he had once told me about his rugby league career. \u201cI played to my strengths,\u201d Rob said. \u201cI had speed and agility. I didn\u2019t try to be anything I wasn\u2019t. I never had any doubts. I\u2019m tougher than I look.\u201dHe almost laughed when he said those words but the sound was trapped in his body.The mighty Rob Burrow was one of the most extraordinary men I have met. He was definitely the toughest. But when I heard on Sunday that death had finally come for him, offering a merciful release after he had suffered so long, I also thought how he had told me of his good fortune.Death was never far from our conversations but Rob\u2019s words were always more tender than they were sombre. The breath caught in the back of my throat when he wrote this line: \u201cThere\u2019s something beautiful about being cared for by the only girl you\u2019ve ever loved.\u201dLindsey was with Rob until the\u00a0very end, showing him the love\u00a0and\u00a0the care that had sustained\u00a0him\u00a0so long."}

The protection of women and girls\u2019 spaces is too important to allow the confusion to continue.\u201dLast year, Badenoch asked the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to advise on the change. The equalities watchdog said the new definition would make it possible to exclude trans people from same-sex spaces even if they hold a gender recognition certificate (GRC).Badenoch said on Sunday that she had concluded the law needed to be changed in order to provide protections based on biological sex, saying it was crucial to allow single-sex groups to meet without those of the opposite biological sex.The law will still protect against discrimination based on the status of gender reassignment, the Conservatives said.The party also said it would change the law to make gender recognition a reserved matter which only the UK government could legislate on, a reaction to the row over the Scottish gender recognition bill, which was blocked by Westminster.Announcing the change, Rishi Sunak said that he wanted to enshrine the right to single-sex spaces in law.\u201cThe safety of women and girls is too important to allow the current confusion around definitions of sex and gender to persist,\u201d he said.\u201cThe Conservatives believe that making this change in law will enhance protections in a way that respects the privacy and dignity of everyone in society.

A further 26 people, registered to vote from abroad, make up the electorate.De Santis, 42, has led the administration since 2009 and had expected competition in the mayoral race from an opposition councillor, 70-year-old Renato Poletto.

There he encountered a coprolite, the technical term for a piece of fossilized feces, which he described as \u201cboth hilarious and fascinating\u201d.\u201cThis sparked my curiosity, leading me to learn everything I could about coprolites,\u201d the 45-year-old Frandsen said to the Guinness World Records website. \u201cI soon realized that these peculiar prehistoric \u2018time capsules\u2019 offer direct insights into the diets, behaviors and environments of ancient creatures.\u201cThis realization fueled my desire to acquire more coprolites, whether by finding them myself or purchasing them, in order to further explore and expand my understanding of prehistoric life.\u201dThat summary of events is arguably an understatement. By 2015, he had amassed nearly 1,300 such pieces, according to the organization known for curating a database of more than 40,000 world records. He brought his collection to the South Florida Museum in the Tampa suburb of Bradenton, where Guinness verified it as the largest of its kind in the world.But that was only the last time the number of pieces in his collection had been officially counted. Since then, as Guinness noted, Frandsen said he has added \u201ca whopping (or plopping) 8,000 pieces\u201d.\u201cI was able to network with people who offered to give, sell and even trade coprolites to me from all over the world\u201d after 2015, said Frandsen, who also owns the world\u2019s largest coprolite from a carnivore, a specimen named Barnum which is 2ft 2.5in (67.5cm) long.George Frandsen with a specimen named Barnum, the world\u2019s largest carnivore coprolite. Photograph: guinnessworldrecords.com videoAt some point, Frandsen said, he noticed \u201ca glaring absence of coprolite representation in mainstream sources and museum exhibits\u201d. So he created a traveling exhibition, which he has let museums across the US borrow.He told Guinness that those museums\u2019 visitors generally responded to the exhibit with enthusiasm, highlighting for him \u201cthe demand for a dedicated space where coprolites could be prominently showcased and their scientific significance thoroughly explored\u201d.Frandsen finally resigned from the healthcare company executive job that he had worked for 14 years, sold his house in Florida and moved 2,000 miles to Williams, Arizona.There, on 18 May, a ways south of the Grand Canyon, he opened the doors of his Poozeum, which he bills as \u201cthe world\u2019s premier dinosaur poop museum and gift shop\u201d.Frandsen\u2019s Poozeum is unrelated to the Pooseum in Tasmania. In 2021, the Tasmanian Pooseum \u2013 which dedicates itself to educating the public about the practical uses of animal dung in the wild and in civilization \u2013 made news headlines for winning a years-long legal fight with local authorities over its right to display a sign depicting a penguin defecating in projectile fashion.The Arizona Poozeum\u2019s founder said his institution \u2013 which \u201ckids especially love\u201d \u2013 aims to provide tourists worldwide \u201ca distinctive, memorable and enjoyable experience during their vacation\u201d, despite how gross it all may first sound.\u201cInitially, many people react with a \u2018yuck\u2019 face or laughter when they first hear about the Poozeum,\u201d Frandsen said to Guinness. \u201cHowever, after witnessing the collection, their reactions often shift to shock at the diverse and intriguing nature of coprolites.\u201cGiven that most people have little to no experience with coprolites, it\u2019s enjoyable to introduce them to this fascinating world and share the wonders they hold.\u201d"}

They had a four-year old \u2013 now 11 \u2013 when they moved in, and they now have a two-year-old, too. \u201cWe did a lot of DIY when our eldest was very little and he got quite used to it,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019d try to join us or take part as best as he could and I think that\u2019s important \u2013 when you have kids, make them feel included and their spaces will feel more like home.\u201dIn the hallway, Medina painted numbers on the stair risers using a stencil.

We call it a light, flashy fuel because it is so fine. It\u2019s very receptive to the fire,\u201d Silveira said.Interstate 580, which connects the San Francisco Bay Area to San Joaquin county in central California, was closed in both directions from Corral Hollow Road to Interstate 5 due to the lack of visibility from the smoke, the California department of transportation said in a statement.Two Alameda county firefighters were injured, according to Alameda county public affairs manager Cheryl Hurd.In a statement on Saturday evening, Hurd said: \u201cTwo ACFD Firefighters suffered minor to moderate burn injuries,\u201d adding that they have been transported to local hospitals, Patch reports.The San Joaquin county office of emergency services issued an evacuation order, pinpointing the wildfire in an area east of Interstate 580. Residents between Corral Hollow Road and Tracy Boulevard were ordered to leave their homes, with residents south of Tracy Boulevard told to be prepared for evacuation.An evacuation update included areas west of the California Aqueduct south of Corral Hollow Creek, west to Alameda county and south to Stanislaus county. A temporary evacuation point was established at Larch Clover community center in Tracy, the county emergency services office said on its website.In a statement on Twitter/X, Stockton\u2019s mayor, Kevin J Lincoln, wrote: \u201cPraying for our Tracy neighbors and first responders. The city of Stockton is providing mutual-aid to the city of Tracy covering a firehouse while they are fighting the Corral Fire.\u201dThe wildfire was near the Lawrence Livermore laboratory\u2019s Site 300 south-west of Tracy, Cal Fire said in a social media post late Saturday.Lawrence Livermore is a research and development institution primarily focusing on the US nuclear weapons stockpile. Site 300, 15 miles (24km) east of the laboratory\u2019s main installation, supports \u201cdevelopment of explosive materials as well as hydrodynamic testing and diagnostics\u201d, according to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory website.\u201cHere, our researchers can safely formulate, fabricate, and test high-explosive assemblies to assess the performance of nonnuclear weapon prototypes and components,\u201d the website says of Site 300.The wildfire presented no threats to any laboratory facilities or operations and the fire had moved away from the site, Lawrence Livermore spokesperson Paul Rhien said in a statement to the Associated Press early on Sunday.\u201cWe have been working in close partnership with Cal Fire, Alameda county Fire Dept, and other emergency services partners throughout the evening,\u201d Rhien said. \u201cAs a precaution, we have activated our emergency operations center to monitor the situation through the weekend.\u201dMeanwhile, the National Weather Service in Sacramento has issued an excessive heat watch starting from Tuesday morning and through Thursday evening. The heat watch spans areas including Carquinez strait and delta, Sacramento valley, Northeast Foothills, northern San Joaquin valley, and portions of Shasta county.In its warning, the NWS said that this level of heat \u201caffects anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration\u201d.

{"title": "Revealed: Russian legal foundation linked to Kremlin activities in Europe | Russia | The Guardian", "caption": "Exclusive: Leaked internal documents show Pravfond has spent millions of euros to finance propaganda and legal campaigns", "author": "Andrew Roth", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/02/revealed-russian-legal-defence-foundation-pravfond-europe", "text": "Leaked internal documents have exposed the activities of a Russian state-backed legal defence foundation that European intelligence agencies and analysts say is in fact a Kremlin influence operation active in 48 countries across Europe and around the world.Internal documents from the Fund for Support and Protection of the Rights of Compatriots Living Abroad (Pravfond) indicate that the foundation finances propaganda websites targeted at Europeans, helped pay for the legal defence of the convicted arms trafficker Viktor Bout and the assassin Vadim Krasikov, and has employed a number of former intelligence officers as the directors of its operations in European countries.The documents show that the group has spent millions of euros to finance propaganda and legal campaigns. Public data also shows that Pravfond\u2019s local partners have received millions in state subsidies from a number of the European states where the foundation operates local branches, raising questions about the use of public funds and national security concerns just days before elections to the European parliament.More than 40 Pravfond documents, obtained by the Danish public broadcaster DR from a European intelligence source and shared with a consortium of European journalists including the Guardian, show that the organisation has had a number of documented former intelligence agents among its leadership. They include Vladimir Pozdorovkin, who has been identified by European intelligence sources as an agent for the SVR, Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, and in public records as Pravfond\u2019s curator for its operations in the Nordic and Baltic countries; and Anatoly Sorokin, who the documents show is a member of the SVR and curates Pravfond\u2019s Middle East, Moldova, and Transnistria division.The head of the Institute of the Russian Diaspora, which is listed on official documents as Pravfond\u2019s \u201cproject implementer\u201d, is Sergey Panteleyev, who has been subject to sanctions in EU countries as a member of a Russian military intelligence unit that specialises in psychological-warfare operations.Andrei Soldatov, an expert on the Russian intelligence services and co-author of The Compatriots, said Pravfond appeared to be a \u201cclassic soft-power effort\u201d and that the ties between intelligence and compatriot organisations were \u201cwell documented\u201d. He noted that Andrey Milyutin, the deputy head of the department of operative information of the fifth service of Russia\u2019s security agency, the FSB, was a member of the government\u2019s committee on \u201ccompatriots living abroad\u201d, indicating the link between intelligence activity and outreach to the Russian diaspora.In a 2020 national security report, the Estonian security services called Pravfond a \u201cpseudo legal protection system\u201d that \u201cin reality is an influence operations fund\u201d, and they have said the FSB uses the groups to recruit collaborators abroad, including among supporters of the 2014 annexation of Crimea, many of whom had ties to the group.Pravfond was founded in 2012 by presidential decree and was backed by the Russian ministry of foreign affairs and the federal agency Rossotrudnichestvo, which administers foreign aid and has been described by the head of Pravfond, Alexander Udaltsov, as a \u201cunique element of Russian soft power\u201d. Udaltsov has been subject to sanctions by the European Union since 2023 for \u201csupporting and implementing actions and policies which undermine and threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine\u201d.Pravfond did not reply to questions sent by the Guardian and by its reporting partners in the week before this publication, although some of the recipients of its local grants did.The documents show that Pravfond sponsored the legal defence of Krasikov, an alleged FSB agent who was given a life sentence for the murder of the former Chechen field commander Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in Berlin\u2019s Tiergarten in 2019. The documents indicate that the lawyer Robert Unger received \u20ac60,000 in legal fees paid out by Pravfond\u2019s budget in 2021 as approved by Udaltsov. A European intelligence source said it possessed documents showing that Unger had received a larger sum of money for representing Krasikov in previous sessions, but could not provide documentation.Asked about the payments, Unger confirmed he had received a request from the journalist consortium but said his mandate for Krasikov ended in 2021 after the life sentence and that because he was \u201cstill subject to legal professional confidentiality even after the end of the mandate and have not been released from it, I am unfortunately prevented from answering your questions\u201d.A Pravfond budget document from 2014 also showed that the organisation had provided significant sums to fund the legal defences of Bout and the convicted drug trafficker Konstantin Yaroshenko, both of whom later returned to Russia as part of prisoner exchanges negotiated between Moscow and Washington.The documents also indicated that Pravfond had spent hundreds of thousands of euros to maintain several websites that purported to fight against \u201cRussophobia\u201d and promote the \u201cdefence of the Russian language\u201d in Europe. It has also funnelled money to a number of fringe publications throughout Europe.Documents obtained by the consortium showed that Pravfond funded the activities of golos.eu, an online portal that operates out of a post-office box in Brussels and mainly provides a vehicle for commentators to voice criticism of the Ukrainian government, particularly the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his top aides and military advisers.Reached for comment by the Guardian, the Golos deputy editor Yuri Andriychenko denied that the site received money from Pravfond or had any links to the Russian state. He suggested that someone else had applied for grant funding using the site\u2019s name, writing: \u201cWe are not surprised that someone in Russia is trying to make money on our name, because it is much easier than creating your own project.\u201dAccording to the internal documents, Pravfond also funds the activities of Euromore, another online portal that focuses heavily on purported threats to Russians in Europe. Euromore was \u201cdesigned to take into account the closure of international platforms\u201d such as RT and Sputnik by the EU authorities and \u201ccreate its own significant alternative\u201d, the documents said. Those sites were largely blacklisted in the west after the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022."}

It is unfortunate that such a big, independent, powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin,\u201d he said.Since a phone call between Zelenskiy and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, one year ago, Ukraine had sought meetings with Chinese officials at all levels, he said, but this had not been granted. He had not met Chinese officials despite their presence in Singapore.Earlier on Sunday, the Chinese defence minister, Dong Jun, told attendees of the Shangri-La Dialogue his country had \u201cbeen promoting peace talks with a responsible attitude\u201d. \u201cWe have never provided weapons to either party of the conflict. We have put stricter control on the export of dual use items and have never done anything to fan the flames. We stand firmly on the side of peace and dialogue,\u201d Dong said.But Zelenskiy said: \u201cWith China\u2019s support to Russia, the war will last longer and that is bad for the whole world. You cannot say that we accept sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and at the same time be on the side of the country that violates the principles of the UN charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201dZelenskiy said on X he had met the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Sunday morning. \u201cWe discussed the key issues: the defence needs of our country, bolstering Ukraine\u2019s air defence system, the F-16 coalition, and drafting of a bilateral security agreement,\u201d he said.He said he was grateful to Joe Biden for his decision to allow Ukraine to use US-supplied weapons against targets in Russia. However, in comments to media he said that this was not enough as Ukraine still did not have the systems or permissions to target airfields from which Russia was \u201cpermanently firing\u201d."}

She stopped short of setting a target, however, saying the Conservatives had failed when they had done so.Meanwhile, Keir Starmer made a renewed pitch for Conservative voters with a manifesto commitment to slash levels of immigration and ban law-breaking employers from hiring foreign workers.Plans outlined by the Labour leader in the Sun on Sunday could include laws to bar companies that break employment law \u2013 by failing to pay the minimum wage, for example \u2013 from hiring workers from overseas. New legislation would also link the immigration system to training, with businesses that apply for foreign worker visas having to train British people to do the jobs.Cooper told the BBC One\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: \u201cWe\u2019re not setting a target and the reason for that is partly because, to be honest, every time the Conservatives have done this, frankly, then they have just ended up being totally all over the place, ripping it up and discredited the whole system.\u201cAlso, because from one year to another, there are variations. So, for example, the pandemic means the net migration figures, of course, fell, but the homes for Ukraine visa rightly meant that the figures increased because of the war in Ukraine.\u201dWhen pressed by Trevor Phillips on Sky News as to whether she believed UK residents could fill the thousands of vacancies in the adult social care sector and replace foreign workers, Cooper said there would continue to be a health and social care visa.\u201cImmigration has always been important to this country, including for international talent and different areas, but it needs to be properly controlled,\u201d she said.James Cleverly, the home secretary, responded to Labour\u2019s plans by taking aim at its leader. \u201cKeir Starmer has a track record of supporting high immigration levels and helping foreign criminals stay in Britain because he believes all immigration law is racist,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is yet another day where Starmer will say what he thinks people want to hear during an election because he lacks conviction to say what he believes.\u201dThe Scottish National party, which held a campaign rally with more than 200 activists and candidates in Glasgow on Sunday afternoon, was critical of Labour\u2019s pledge to cut net migration.The SNP leader, John Swinney, said Scottish businesses were struggling to fill vacancies, adding: \u201cThe biggest economic threat to Scotland is the current hostility towards migration that we have from the UK.\u201dTo applause, Swinney said Starmer\u2019s rhetoric was \u201cplaying to a particular audience\u201d that did not exist in Scotland\u201d.The UK has experienced broadly similar levels of immigration as other high-income countries over the past few decades, according to the University of Oxford\u2019s Migration Observatory. Net migration \u2013 a commonly used measure of the overall scale of migration \u2013 was \u201cunusually high\u201d in the 12 months up to the end of June 2023, the thinktank said in January.On illegal immigration, Cooper said Labour\u2019s \u201cinitial assessments\u201d suggested it would take a year to stop spending money on hotels to accommodate asylum seekers.While Labour has pledged to scrap the government\u2019s Rwanda scheme, Cooper declined to rule out sending asylum seekers to another country to have their claims processed.\u201cKeir has always said we would look at what works and there are different kinds of \u2026 offshore processing arrangements and things that have already been used at different times in the past,\u201d she told the BBC."}

Last year Trump boasted he could end the war in \u201c24 hours\u201d.Trump\u2019s aides have previously sketched out a possible plan that would involve giving Ukraine\u2019s eastern regions to Russia, as well as Crimea. But Zelenskiy made clear that \u201cUkrainians would not put up with that\u201d. Nor would they accept a Russian \u201cultimatum\u201d that forced Ukraine to abandon integration with Europe and future membership of Nato, he said.Zelenskiy acknowledged that a re-elected Trump could, if he really wanted to, impose a crushing military defeat on Ukraine. He could cut off \u201csupport, weapons and money\u201d, and even \u201cmake deals\u201d with Kyiv\u2019s partners so they stop deliveries of vital arms.\u201cUkraine, barehanded, without weapons, will not be able to fight a multimillion [Russian] army,\u201d Zelenskiy told the Guardian.Speaking inside his presidential headquarters, he said he thought this scenario was unlikely. But he said if it happened there would be grave consequences for the US\u2019s standing in the world \u2013 as well as for Trump personally. \u201cDoes he want to become a loser president? Do you understand what can happen?\u201d Zelenskiy said.He predicted that Vladimir Putin would violate any Trump-brokered deal. \u201cA ceasefire is a trap,\u201d he said. After a pause Putin would \u201cgo further\u201d, humiliating Trump and making him look \u201cvery weak\u201d in the eyes of the world, he said.Zelenskiy continued: \u201cThis is not about him [Trump], as a person but about the institutions of the United States. They will become very weak. The US will not be the leader of the world any more. Yes, it will be powerful, first of all, in the domestic economy because it has a powerful economy without a doubt. But in terms of international influence it will be equal to zero.\u201dRealising that Washington was no longer \u201ca player\u201d, other mostly authoritarian countries and leaders would \u201ccome into the arena\u201d and emulate Putin\u2019s aggressive \u201capproach\u201d, Zelenskiy suggested.And this would ultimately end in global disaster: \u201cThe beginning of what everyone is so afraid to talk about. This is reality. And this is the real third world war.\u201dAsked whether Johnson had spoken to Trump on Ukraine\u2019s behalf, Zelenskiy said: \u201cI think he tried, and I think he spoke to him. I think so, yes, as far as I know.\u201dHe added: \u201cI am sorry that I am using Boris as an instrument.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The $61bn military aid package passed in April after a six-month delay.Zelenskiy made his comments a day before a New York jury on Thursday convicted Trump of all 34 counts of falsifying business records. The verdict in the hush-money trial made him the first former president to be found guilty of felony crimes in the US\u2019s near 250-year history.In 2019, as president, Trump rang Zelenskiy and asked him to investigate his election rival Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter. If Zelenskiy failed to find dirt on Hunter Biden, US security assistance to Ukraine would be withheld, Trump suggested, according to a leak of the call. The scandal led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment.Zelenskiy said he had invited Trump to visit Ukraine. \u201cI want to talk to him openly. I want him to come and see the war for himself.

It followed days of speculation that Abbot would be blocked from standing, culminating in her accusing Labour of carrying out a \u201ccull of leftwingers\u201d.On Sunday evening Abbott also denied a report that she had been offered a seat in the House of Lords if she agreed to stand aside in the constituency she has represented for 37 years.\u201cI have never been offered a seat in the Lords, and would not accept one if offered. I am the adopted Labour candidate for Hackney North & Stoke Newington.

There\u2019s a whole process with the independent committee that will vet nominations. There have to be processes in terms of the numbers of nominations designated by the prime minister and so on.\u201dCooper said that \u201cno party can do that or make that sort of commitment\u201d, but in practice party leaders and the prime minister do have that power. While nominations are vetted by an independent committee, it is for political parties to decide who receives them. The committee checks if the nominee is a person of good standing but does not have a veto.Abbott was widely expected by Labour MPs to announce her retirement and be given a peerage, until a Labour source briefed last week that she would be banned from standing, after which Abbott said she still intended to fight to be a candidate.She was suspended from the party last year after writing a letter to the Observer saying that Jewish people and Travellers suffered prejudice but not racism, comparing their experiences with those of people with red hair.Abbott apologised for her remarks but was placed under investigation and lost the Labour whip.At one stage, the possibility of her standing as an independent had been a real one. She told a rally of supporters last week that she intended to stand in the general election \u201cby any means possible\u201d.Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC) will hold a crucial meeting on Tuesday to decide whether or not to endorse a range of candidates for a number of remaining seats.The party has already announced a flurry of candidates in safe seats who are close allies of Starmer and have been instrumental in overhauling the party since Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Election EditionMake sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

Starmer will appear at one public event on Monday but will then turn his full focus to preparations.Over the last few months, Starmer\u2019s team have deliberately picked events which involve Q&As with groups of workers, with one eye on getting him debate-ready. \u201cWe know that people are quite cautious about asking difficult questions in front of their bosses, but there have been a few, and it\u2019s good practice,\u201d said one Labour source. \u201cBut we definitely haven\u2019t drafted in any Labour councillors.\u201dAnother added: \u201cThe debate will be a big moment. It\u2019s the first time that many voters will have seen Keir and Sunak go head to head as they will only just have started paying attention to politics since the election was called. But we\u2019re feeling confident. Keir is good at this stuff, and he\u2019s well prepared.\u201dInternally, Labour also has a crucial week. On Tuesday the national executive committee will meet to finally approve all candidates for elections, the crunch point for any final complaints or resignations, but it is now seen as broadly a formality.While Starmer is focused on debate preparations until Tuesday, the leader\u2019s attention after that will be on the manifesto. On Friday, Labour will convene its pivotal \u201cclause V\u201d meeting, where its most influential figures will go through the manifesto line by line and thrash out any outstanding differences.Those present will include the shadow cabinet, MPs on the parliamentary Labour party committee, the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, the Welsh first minister, Vaughan Gething, and 11 trade union general secretaries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Election EditionMake sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

{"title": "PM must face questions about hedge fund at heart of financial crash, says Labour | General election 2024 | The Guardian", "caption": "Keir Starmer aims to turn spotlight on Sunak\u2019s career before politics in lead up to first general election TV debate", "author": "Jessica Elgot", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/02/pm-must-face-questions-about-hedge-fund-at-heart-of-financial-crash-says-labour", "text": "Rishi Sunak must face questions about the fortune he earned at a hedge fund which engineered a deal at the heart of the financial crash, Labour has said, as it prepares to launch its first major attack on the prime minister ahead of the election debates.The party aims to turn the spotlight on Sunak\u2019s time before politics in the days before the first TV debate between the two leaders, after a week dominated by rows over Diane Abbott\u2019s candidacy. On Sunday, she confirmed she would stand as Labour\u2019s candidate.Key to Labour\u2019s attempt to get back on the front foot will be to scrutinise Sunak\u2019s time as a partner at TCI, the hedge fund which launched an activist campaign against Dutch bank ABN Amro which resulted in its sale to RBS in 2007. The takeover was later described as \u201can extremely risky deal\u201d by the independent financial regulator which said it was a key factor leading to RBS\u2019s failure.Starmer also on Sunday promised to cut net migration by training unemployed Britons to do jobs normally taken by overseas workers. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, told broadcasters that it was clear net migration must come down, though stopped short of setting a target.Starmer and Sunak will go head-to-head on ITV at the first election debate this Tuesday.Starmer hopes to force an interrogation of Sunak on his past at TCI, after their involvement in the deal that saw a bank riddled with sub-prime mortgages sold to RBS. Separately, Sunak\u2019s boss at the multi-billion fund, Chris Hohn, admitted to a select committee in January 2009 that the fund had bet against British banks during the crash.Sunak was a partner in TCI when it began pushing the sale of ABN Amro via its 1% stake in the Dutch bank in early 2007 and lobbied heavily for RBS\u2019s takeover bid. The RBS-led consortium bought ABN Amro for \u00a350bn in October 2007 \u2013 the biggest takeover in banking history.The taxpayer spent \u00a345.5bn bailing out RBS and the independent regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), said \u201cit is clear that the acquisition undoubtedly contributed significantly to RBS\u2019s vulnerability\u201d.Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, told the Guardian he believed Sunak had \u201cbet against Britain\u201d during his time before politics. \u201cIf I was still a member of the liaison committee, I would definitely have been asking questions about his past behaviour, because I think it\u2019s in the public interest that voters know that he essentially bet against Britain and may have profited off the back of it,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is exactly the type of past behaviour where if you become a public official or you come into public office, you need to be accountable and transparent about that.\u201dThere is no suggestion that Sunak or TCI broke any rules during the sale of ABN Amro. But Jones said it was a matter of the integrity of the man who became chancellor and then prime minister.\u201cI think that there is a public interest in him fessing up about his role during this period of time and people understanding the fact that when they were having to suffer the consequences of austerity that followed under the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in coalition years, that Rishi Sunak was at the heart of this,\u201d he said.Jones said records show Sunak was one of a very small team. TCI had 19 partners during the two years the deal took place.He said that Sunak would have been aware of the deal. \u201cThis was the biggest banking deal at the time.\u201d The Treasury has previously said Sunak did not have a direct role in the deal.A Conservative spokesperson said in response to the attack: \u201cThis is not correct. The Labour party created the banking crisis which caused Labour\u2019s great recession. In 2008, while Starmer chose to be in a foreign court defending terrorists, Rachel Reeves was part of the mortgage team at HBOS that had to be bailed out by the taxpayer at a cost of tens of billions and turfed thousands of families from their homes.\u201dThe BBC announced on Sunday night that the second of the leaders\u2019 debates had been scheduled for 26 June \u2013 the last week of the campaign. Labour is unlikely to agree to any further debates for the party leader.Labour will also hope to see the end of rows over candidate selections which dominated the news agenda last week, though the ousted Chingford and Woodford Green candidate Faiza Shaheen is still considering legal action.On Tuesday morning, Labour\u2019s national executive committee will rubber stamp all of the candidates, which include a string of key allies of Starmer. Last week, Starmer was forced to U-turn on a reported plan to engineer the retirement of Abbott and said last week she was free to stand in Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Her close friend Shami Chakrabarti raised the possibility Abbott could still retire, saying she was being encouraged to think about her political future. Abbott confirmed on Sunday afternoon she would stand again as an MP, with the party\u2019s backing."}

Mexico has one of the highest homicide rates in Latin America and hundreds of organised crime groups, ranging from the small and local up to those with international presence and the kind of firepower typically reserved for armies.These groups have diversified from drug to gun and migrant trafficking, and have penetrated local businesses and supply chains, from tortilla stands to avocado farms.This year\u2019s elections have been the most violent in Mexican history, with more than 30 candidates murdered and hundreds more dropping out as criminal groups vie to install friendly leaders.On Wednesday, the final day of the campaign, a hired killer filmed himself shooting the opposition mayoral candidate Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Cabrera in the town of Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez, Guerrero, before being shot dead by bodyguards.\u201cThere is much violence \u2013 perhaps not in Mexico City, but in the rest of the country,\u201d said Vanessa Romero, a political analyst.Tens of thousands of supporters of Morena packed the Z\u00f3calo, Mexico City\u2019s main square, on Wednesday for the final event of Sheinbaum\u2019s campaign.But the mood is less excited than in 2018, when L\u00f3pez Obrador broke the grip that Mexico\u2019s traditional parties had held on the presidency, winning by a landslide and promising to transform a country racked by inequality, corruption and violence.Outside a barbershop in Benito Ju\u00e1rez, a wealthy neighbourhood in Mexico City, Salim said he voted for Morena in 2018 but wouldn\u2019t this time.\u201cWhat changed? Nothing,\u201d said Salim. \u201cThey\u2019re the same as the others. Only the speeches are different.\u201dRoc\u00edo, who was visiting from the Yucat\u00e1n city of M\u00e9rida, which is governed by the conservative Pan party, took a more understanding view.\u201cMexico\u2019s always had corruption,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now it has [big infrastructure projects] like the Mayan Train \u2013 that\u2019s a difference.\u201dYet Morena\u2019s appeal is better understood from places such as Macon\u00ed, a small community in the state of Quer\u00e9taro that gets water just a few hours a week.\u201cWe\u2019re with Morena, and Morena is with us,\u201d said Don Jos\u00e9, a 66-year old man who was a migrant worker in the US for many years. \u201cThis country is changing, and the scoundrels that ruled for decades are on the way out. We would die of thirst before they paid attention to us.\u201dOver the last three months, Sheinbaum has crisscrossed the country in an effort to rally such voters \u2013 not just to assure Morena retains the presidency, but to win it a level of political power not seen since Mexico became a democracy in 2000.Morena and its allies already control a simple majority in both houses of congress and two-thirds of the governorships in Mexico\u2019s 32 states.The election could, in theory, gain it three more governorships on Sunday \u2013 though many of the races are too close to call, and the opposition are hopeful of wresting Mexico City from Morena\u2019s control.But if Scheinbaum\u2019s party emerges with a two-thirds supermajority in congress, it would be able to amend the constitution at will.Polling suggests it is unlikely. But Morena already has a package of reforms in mind that includes allowing supreme court justices to be elected by popular vote, which could give it control over the country\u2019s top court.This has led some to sound the alarm.\u201cWhy do we have to mobilise? Because Claudia is a danger to democracy,\u201d said G\u00e1lvez, the opposition candidate.\u201cI think the risk is being exaggerated for electoral reasons,\u201d said Romero, who points out that Morena is proposing a democracy with more popular participation. \u201cIt\u2019s not about democracy versus authoritarianism. It\u2019s about one vision of democracy versus another.\u201dOthers are more concerned.\u201cMexico is moving to what some in Morena call \u2018hegemonic democracy\u2019, which by their definition isn\u2019t exactly a representative liberal democracy, but nor is it authoritarian,\u201d said Humberto Beck, a historian. \u201cIt\u2019s something else beyond that dichotomy, which is lent legitimacy by popular support.\u201cI think this is an announcement of democratic regression,\u201d added Beck.North of the border, the Biden administration has been noticeably quiet about L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s attacks on Mexico\u2019s institutions throughout his term, apparently prioritising cooperation on fentanyl trafficking and migration as it approaches its own election later this year."}

He will be sentenced on 11 July at 10am ET."}

When you can rig an election, then weaponize the government and the courts against a former President, what other alternative is there? I\u2019m almost 70 and would rather die than live in tyranny.\u201dThat\u2019s a common version of how many people on the US right reacted to the ex-president\u2019s verdict, drawing on a \u201cmirror world\u201d where Trump is seen as the selfless martyr to powerful state forces and Joe Biden is the dangerous autocrat wielding the justice system as his own personal plaything and a threat to US democracy.Calls for revenge, retribution and violence littered the rightwing internet as soon as Trump\u2019s guilty verdict came down, all predicated on the idea that the trial had been a sham designed to interfere with the 2024 election. Some posted online explicitly saying it was time for hangings, executions and civil wars.In this case, Trump was charged with falsifying documents related to a hush-money payment made to an adult film actor to keep an alleged affair out of the spotlight during the 2016 election \u2013 a form of election interference from a man whose platform lately consists largely of blaming others for election interference. The verdict has been followed by a backlash from his followers, those who for years chanted to lock up Trump\u2019s political opponents, like Hillary Clinton.A Trump supporter waves an inverted American flag outside Trump Tower on 31 May 2024. Photograph: John Minchillo/APOn the left, the mood was downright celebratory, a brief interlude of joy that Trump might finally be held accountable for his actions. But there was an undercurrent of worry among some liberals, who saw the way these felonies could galvanize support for him.On the right, in the alternate reality created by and for Trump and his supporters, the convictions are a sign of both doom and dogma \u2013 evidence that a corrupt faction runs the Joe Biden government, but that it can be driven out by the Trump faithful like themselves.Trump\u2019s allies in Congress want to use the federal government\u2019s coffers to send a message to Biden that the verdict crosses a line, saying the jury\u2019s decision \u201cturned our judicial system into a political cudgel\u201d. Some Senate Republicans vowed not to cooperate with Democratic priorities or nominees \u2013 effectively politicizing the government as recompense for what they claim is a politicization of the courts.They echoed a claim Trump himself has repeatedly driven home to his followers: that his political opponents, namely Biden, are a threat to democracy, a rebrand of how Biden and Democrats often cast Trump. For his most ardent followers, the stakes of the 2024 election are existential, the idea that he might lose a cause for intense rhetoric and threats.And, for some, the convictions provide another reason to take matters into their own hands during a time when support for using violence to achieve political goals is on the rise. Indictments against Trump fueled this support, surveys have shown.Some rightwing media and commentators, like Bongino and the Gateway Pundit, displayed upside-down flags on social media, a sign of distress and a symbol among Trump supporters that recently made the news because one flew at US supreme court justice Samuel Alito\u2019s home after the insurrection.Trump supporters outside Trump Tower on 31 May 2024.

These threats include FBI raids, investigations, indictments and even jail time.He has also threatened or suggested that the FBI and justice department should take action against senators, judges, members of Biden\u2019s family and even non-governmental organisations.\u201cHe is promising to go after what he perceives to be his political enemies,\u201d said Robert Maguire, vice-president for research and data at Crew. \u201cHe is promising to essentially weaponise the government against anyone he sees as not sufficiently loyal or who is openly opposed to him.\u201cHe has constantly seeded this idea that the numerous charges against him are trumped-up charges and it seems almost to have given him licence to openly say, \u2018You\u2019ve done this to me, so I\u2019m going to do it to you.\u2019\u201dTrump launched Truth Social in early 2022 after he was banned from major sites such as Facebook and the platform formerly known as Twitter following the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Although he has since been reinstated to both, he has mostly stayed off X, as it is now called, the Elon Musk-owned platform that was once his primary megaphone.Trump reaches far fewer people on his platform, where he has fewer than 7 million followers, than he might on X, where he boasts 87 million. The research firm Similarweb estimates that Truth Social had roughly 5m monthly visits in February of this year. This compares with more than 2bn for TikTok and more than 3bn for Facebook.The study is part of a larger Crew project tracking and analysing Trump\u2019s Truth Social posts. The watchdog says that Trump\u2019s niche following means that the extent of his threats has flown mostly under the radar. There have also been concerns about Trump fatigue over the past decade, with some voters numbed and inured to statements that would have been jaw-dropping from any other president.Maguire said: \u201cHis comments are often reported on or discussed as one-offs. \u2018Trump said this today,\u2019 and people talk about it and then it fades away because Trump said something else the next day or the next week or the next month.\u201cWe figured it would be helpful to quantify these comments that he\u2019s making to show this isn\u2019t just a whim or a passing idea that he put out in the world because he saw somebody say something on TV. It\u2019s a fixation of his, it\u2019s a promise he\u2019s making to use the government in ways that are squarely unethical.\u201dCrew duly analysed more than 13,000 of Trump\u2019s Truth Social posts from 1 January 2023 to 1 April 2024 and found that, while the former president has recently dialed down some of his more violent rhetoric, he remains fixated on threatening political opponents.Donald Trump, pictured here on 31 May, a day after he was found guilty of 34 criminal charges, has vowed to retaliate against his many perceived enemies. Photograph: Julia Nikhinson/APIts report, the first in a series, says his attitude can be summed up in one Truth Social post from August 2023: \u201cIF YOU GO AFTER ME, I\u2019M COMING AFTER YOU!\u201d Indeed, last December Trump posted a word cloud based on his speeches: the biggest word was \u201crevenge\u201d.Many of his threats to Biden reflect Trump\u2019s now familiar tactic of reversing charges against his opponents, conjuring a mirror world in which he claims they are guilty of the very offence of which he is accused.In one post about the special counsel Jack Smith, he warned that there will be \u201crepercussions far greater than anything that Biden or his Thugs could understand\u201d and, if the investigations continue, it will open a \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d of retribution.In another, Trump wrote that his federal indictments are \u201csetting a BAD precedent for yourself, Joe.

In one post he called on the attorney general, Merrick Garland, to \u201cimmediately end Special Counsel investigation into anything related to me because I did everything right, and appoint a Special Counsel to investigate Joe Biden who hates Biden as much as Jack Smith hates me\u201d.In another he asked: \u201cWhen will Joe Biden be Indicted for his many crimes against our Nation?\u201d Trump has posted about this repeatedly, promising to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Biden, and indict him if Trump returns to the White House for a second term.Trump has \u201creTruthed\u201d others\u2019 posts about Biden that are even more ominous. In June last year he reposted a clip from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene asserting: \u201cJoe Biden shouldn\u2019t just be impeached, he should be handcuffed and hauled out of the White House for his crimes.\u201dThe former president also posted a screenshot of a different post saying the FBI should \u201craid all of [Biden\u2019s] residences and seize anything they want, including his passports\u201d.Some posts announced plans for retribution against the specific lawyers, judges and other officials whom Trump blames for his legal troubles. Two months before he was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, he reposted a call for the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, to be \u201cput in jail\u201d.He has reposted calls for Jack Smith and others to be locked up and to \u201cthrow away the key.\u201d One reTruth promised to charge the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, along with Bragg, Smith, Garland and Biden, with conspiracy and racketeering.Trump has also made threats to non-profit organisations because of their work. Last November he posted on Truth Social: \u201cFor any radical left charity, non-profit, or so called aid organizations supporting these caravans and illegal aliens, we will prosecute them for their participation in human trafficking, child smuggling, and every other crime we can find.\u201dCrew argues that the posts should not be taken as empty threats but as a wake-up call for Congress to erect meaningful guardrails against the weaponisation of law enforcement agencies before it is too late.The group has called on Congress to pass the Protecting Our Democracy Act (Poda), which would curb abuses of power by presidents of any party and strengthen Congress\u2019s ability to fulfil its constitutional role as a check on executive branch overreach. The legislation passed the House of Representatives in 2021 on a bipartisan basis but has since languished in the Senate.Maguire added: \u201cIt is critical in making sure that law enforcement and the Department of Justice \u2013 all of the things that that entails, both the federal prosecutors and the FBI \u2013 cannot be manipulated by the president to go after political enemies. That would go a long way to hamstringing any effort by any president, to be clear, to use those law enforcement powers to go against political enemies.\u201d"}

Within a few months, there will be 162; within a decade, with another gigantic project proposed next door, about 350.And that\u2019s just to the north. In every other direction, Finlay says with a sweep of his hand, wind developers are knocking on farmers\u2019 doors.\u201cPeople either like wind turbines or they don\u2019t like them. It\u2019s quite polarising,\u201d says Finlay, once president of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation and now chair of the government\u2019s centrepiece drought policy, the Future Drought Fund. He says the view \u201cdoesn\u2019t really worry me\u201d.\u2018Income diversification is critical for long-term survival in Australian agriculture,\u2019 says Brent Finlay, who chairs the Future Drought Fund. Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianAt least 30 turbines are located on Finlay\u2019s land. For him and the nine other landowners hosting the MacIntyre windfarm, it is a financial lifeline.The project is the largest onshore windfarm in the southern hemisphere and covers about 36,000 hectares of rocky grazing country south of the rural town of Karara, about 200km south-west of Brisbane. Five years ago it suffered its worst drought in living memory.\u201cIncome diversification is critical for long-term survival in Australian agriculture,\u201d Finlay says. \u201cWhat we hear in the predictions are larger droughts, longer droughts, deeper droughts into the future.\u201dGovernments may have their sights on renewable energy \u2013 critical for reducing reliance on fossil fuels in order to curb the worst of global heating \u2013 but for farmers, it\u2019s more about surviving it at all.The deal struck by the group of landowners and the windfarm\u2019s developer, Spanish renewable energy giant Acciona, is confidential, but lobby group Farmers for Climate Action has said annual payments to farmers average $40,000 a turbine.That estimate would put total compensation, shared between the 10 landowners, at $162m over the project\u2019s 25-year lease agreement. It is a potentially significant additional income alongside earnings from their wool and meat operations that can coexist with turbines humming overhead.Finlay calls himself a \u201crenewable energy farmer\u201d, but not everyone is convinced.What about the neighbours?\u201cEveryone over there has got turbines and I don\u2019t begrudge that,\u201d says grazier Scott Tait.Tait runs cattle on a property at Karara but lives outside the area. \u201cIf we were offered the opportunity to host turbines I suppose we\u2019d take it too,\u201d he says.From a hill on his property, which Tait says he planned to build a house on, the blades of half a dozen MacIntyre turbines poke above a distant stand of eucalypts. Tait says Acciona representatives assured him the turbines wouldn\u2019t be visible from his house site.\u2018There needs to be a better system of taking into account the impact on small rural communities,\u2019 says Scott Tait, a neighbour of the MacIntyre windfarm. Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianThe new development on Acciona\u2019s books, Herries Range, will see turbines built in the other direction. The rapidly expanding landscape of steel towers and fibreglass blades that stretch 285m into the sky has left Tait saying he feels powerless. And unlike his neighbours who host turbines, he had not received any compensation.It is this group of people \u2013 neighbours, not hosts \u2013 who are showing a growing resentment toward the renewable energy boom. French energy company Engie this week announced a plan to offer a $1,000 rebate on energy bills to those who live near its solar and wind developments in an effort to build support.\u201cIf this is the way we have to go, if this is the future, there needs to be a better system of taking into account the impact on small rural communities,\u201d Tait says.MacIntyre windfarm, the largest windfarm under construction in Australia. Photograph: David Kelly/The Guardian Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianIn a statement, an Acciona spokesperson said Tait\u2019s land is more than 5km from the nearest turbine and the company will continue to engage with him about his concerns while \u201cdiscussing potential impact and mitigation\u201d.Mitigating the impact on rural communities is a concern in renewable energy developments across the country, says former national energy infrastructure commissioner Andrew Dyer. Neighbour agreements \u2013 compensation for landowners who don\u2019t host turbines themselves but are close to properties that do \u2013 can allay concerns.\u201cIt means neighbours can then be part of the winning team rather than the losing team,\u201d Dyer tells Guardian Australia.Windfarm development is attracting complaints from locals dissatisfied with what they perceive as a lack of consultation. Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianA review authored by Dyer found Australia\u2019s renewable energy rollout had created a \u201cmaterial distrust\u201d of energy developers due to a lack of community engagement. The government has committed $20.7m to implementing its recommendations.Should Australia go nuclear? Why Peter Dutton's plan could be an atomic failure \u2013 video\u201cIt\u2019s the fear of the unknown that often drives tension and concern, that\u2019s fair enough, we\u2019d all be concerned,\u201d Dyer says.

Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianUnlike the vast land holdings that host the MacIntyre windfarm, Greymare is dotted with retirees and tree-changers on small hobby farms.The meeting was organised by Rose Uwins and Lindy Bennett, who moved to the area from Melbourne. \u201cWe have not had one iota of consultation, we have not been able to have a say, we have not been able to have an opinion,\u201d Bennett says.It\u2019s not the only community with concerns: last week the South Burnett regional council unanimously called for a moratorium on renewable energy projects until strict conditions are met.Opposition to renewable developments ranges from the lack of consultation and the visual impact to the localised environmental impacts, increases in traffic and increased pressure on an already stretched rental market.MacIntyre\u2019s construction workforce peaked at about 750 last year. The majority lived in an on-site workers\u2019 camp, but some lived in the nearby town of Warwick in the Southern Downs regional council.

Photograph: David Kelly/The Guardian\u201cA lot of families who could afford rent before have found themselves homeless,\u201d she says.Wind developers are required to pay rates to local councils of roughly $10,000 per turbine. According to Acciona, the MacIntyre project has so far poured $678m into Queensland businesses, will employ up to 40 people and distribute $250,000 in community grants annually once operational and is supported by 58% of locals. The company said they could \u201clearn from\u201d the housing issue.At Greymare, some locals who have watched the MacIntyre development are arguing in support of the economic benefit of hosting a windfarm in their community, too.David Lawler, one of 25 farmers in early talks with a renewable energy developer.

He said he had no issue with Forrest personally, but objected to the \u201cswindle-factory so-called windfarms all over our area\u201d.\u201cI thought I\u2019ll make a statement so people will say, \u2018why are you doing that?\u2019\u201d he said.Well, mission accomplished. But I remain confused. Because in the place of the RMs at question time earlier this month was a pair of Ariat cowboy boots. Specifically, my image searching revealed, the Cowpuncher VentTEK in the dark brown/golden mustard colourway.Andrew Forrest urges shift to renewables and attacks 'bulldust of nuclear policies'  \u2013 videoAccording to the product description, the boots are designed to provide \u201ca soft landing when you jump off the feed truck or off your horse\u201d, while the vents in the scrolling \u201ckeeps you cool in the heat or in branding season\u201d.This is fine. I\u2019ve got nothing against a good pair of Ariats, though as a horse rider in the English disciplines my Ariats are a pair of half chaps. (That also precisely ages me, for anyone who follows equestrian fashion trends.)They\u2019re also more comfortable than RM Williams \u2013 Joyce said as much in that interview. They\u2019re a work boot, and he is at work, and as a person who wears farm boots literally everywhere I cannot begrudge him on an aesthetic level.But what perplexes me is why he chose Ariats. Ariat is a quintessentially American brand \u2013 it\u2019s named for the racehorse Secretariat. This would be like an American politician trying to appeal to their patriotic base by wearing boots called Phar Lap. The main argument for Australian politicians wearing RM Williams is that they are an iconic Australian brand \u2013 although before Forrest bought it the brand was owned by LVMH, more commonly known as Louis Vuitton.The Australiana is, in the theatre of parliament, the whole point. We don\u2019t give visiting dignitaries an Akubra and a Driza-Bone because they\u2019re appropriate bureaucratic attire. If this can be cancelled out by a mining magnate following the economic winds and investing in renewable energy, a decision that whatever other motives you might ascribe is clearly that of a billionaire making a business decision, then we may as well have been wearing lace-ups this whole time.Ariat is also not necessarily a choice that signals disdain for renewable energy: the Fisher family, founders of the Gap, bought the equestrian apparel company in 2012. The Gap has an emissions reduction goal of 90% by 2030 and its chairman, Robert Fisher, is an environmentalist who sat for 20 years on the board of the National Resources Defense Council, an organisation which supports, among other things, federal tax incentives to boost the renewable economy and responsible construction of offshore windfarms.Barnaby Joyce seen in his Ariat boots: \u2018Not necessarily a choice that signals disdain for renewable energy.\u2019 Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPIt is particularly perplexing because another boot option is right there: Gina Rinehart, who very loudly does not support renewable energy, bought Rossi Boots through her company S Kidman & Co in December. As the Australian Financial Review pointed out, this set the stage for the \u201cbattle of the billionaire boots\u201d. You can now signal your allegiance simply by the stitching on your boot tug.Blundstone, which is still Australian-owned although they are no longer manufactured in Tasmania, is another option. Or Baxters, also Australian-owned and manufactured overseas.As an extremely dorky horse girl who was \u2013 and remains \u2013 incapable of tying shoelaces so they won\u2019t become unravelled within 20 minutes, I have owned all of these boots.I have RMs for the office, Blundstones for walking through mud on the farm, and Dublin short boots (or Jodhpur or paddock boots or whatever you want to call them except for Chelsea boot) for riding. The key consideration, with the exception of the RMs, which my mum gave me for my 30th birthday when she realised I was turning up to the office in a pair of extremely beat-up 15-year-old Baxters, is cost of replacement. I wear my boots until my socks soak through and the average lifespan is about two years.Joyce\u2019s Ariat roper boots ($450) or the standard shoe of Australian politics or consulting, the RM Craftsman ($649), are too expensive for such use. The latter are sale day boots, fancy boots \u2013 that\u2019s the reason the National party started wearing them in the first place. You would never wear your work boots to a livestock sale or a dinner or a political meeting. The well-kept chestnut leather of a pair of RMs that spends the rest of the month sitting buffed clean in the wardrobe is a sign of respect.Despite the price tag, roper boots don\u2019t really have that cachet. It\u2019s one thing to pretend to be a working farmer, it\u2019s another to cosplay as Clinton Anderson.But perhaps that\u2019s the point. The Australian right is increasingly importing tactics from rightwing groups in the US, it may as well copy the footwear. As Joyce took to the stage at an anti-renewables rally in Canberra earlier this year, a man shouted into the microphone: \u201cWe need someone like Donald Trump to save us.\u201dHe may be a shoo-in."}

In its report, released in May 2022, the inquiry chair, Labor MP Greg Donnelly, said the committee \u201cheard stories of emergency departments with no doctors; of patients being looked after by cooks and cleaners; of excessive wait times for treatment; and of misdiagnoses and medical errors\u201d. It highlighted the particular difficulties for border communities, singling out Tenterfield, just 50km up the road from Deepwater and a whisker away from the Queensland border.A second parliamentary inquiry looking into the response to the first inquiry began this week.Lindy Newsome tending to her horses.

Reliable data for subsequent years is not yet available.\u201cQueensland is not alone in this problem,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing rising mental health crisis across the country and it really just needs to be addressed by federal and state governments.\u201d\u2018Services are at capacity or over capacity\u2019Robinson says the drivers of youth suicide are complex and there is no single cause.\u201cThe majority of young people who die from suicide have experienced mental health problems or psychological distress,\u201d she says.Risk factors include self-harm, childhood trauma, childhood adversity, and \u201ca family history of mental health and bereavement [or] exposure to suicide\u201d, Robinson says.Bullying, both online and in real life, is also a major concern.Lomas\u2019 mother, Melissa Wilkinson, says her daughter experienced mental health issues and she does not feel she was treated with compassion during hospital visits prior to her death.Skyla Lomas experienced mental health issues before she took her own life.Lomas says she felt it was seen more as \u201cattention-seeking behaviour\u201d.Guardian Australia contacted the Queensland Children\u2019s Hospital for comment.In the years since her daughter\u2019s death, Wilkinson has undertaken suicide intervention training. She believes mental health first aid should be taught in schools.Robinson agrees more resources are needed.\u201cServices are at capacity or over capacity,\u201d she says.\u201cYoung people are having to wait far longer than they should to access services like a GP service, a Headspace primary care service, [or] tertiary mental health specialists care when they\u2019re really unwell.\u201d\u2018She had the biggest heart\u2019Sam Davis lost her 13-year-old daughter, Chloe, to suicide seven years ago.Sam Davis (right) with daughter Chloe who died from suicide aged 13. Photograph: SuppliedAt the time there were rumours that intimate images of Chloe were being circulated online. Police found no evidence of these images and there were no allegations of \u201csextortion\u201d, but Sam says her daughter was \u201cembarrassed and ashamed\u201d. What drove Chloe to take her own life ultimately remains unknown.Davis says her daughter always wanted to make everyone else happy.\u201cI just felt like she didn\u2019t get that in return. She had the biggest heart.\u201dChloe wanted to make everyone happy but \u2018felt like she didn\u2019t get that in return\u2019, her mother says. Photograph: SuppliedRobinson says one of the biggest reasons that people are calling Kids Helpline at the moment is because of image-based abuse \u2013 where intimate photos are shared without consent.Kids Helpline confirmed they have seen a consistent increase in sextortion, receiving 431 reports between July 2017 and June 2023. Prior to January 2021, there were fewer than five reports a month. The organisation is now responding to about 30 reports a month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He described having \u201ccrazy\u201d and depressive thoughts and disclosed detoxing from cannabis, according to a coroner\u2019s report.Three days later the 17-year-old attempted suicide near his grandmother\u2019s house and later died in hospital from his injuries.\u201cJosh would have a poker face. So he needed someone like me to essentially translate and advocate for him,\u201d Wharton said.\u201cWe\u2019re not taking appropriate actions and we\u2019re not listening to parents.\u201dJoshua Klumper with his mum, Ursula Wharton.Kolves said it can be challenging for health care workers to gauge the needs of neurodiverse people.\u201cClinicians need to know how to deal with suicide risk,\u201d she says.Wharton was left \u201cdisappointed\u201d by a coronial inquest into her son\u2019s death which occurred due to her consistent advocacy.The inquest found that \u201cwhilst Josh was experiencing psychological stressors, there is no evidence he was seriously psychiatrically unwell on 2 or 5 September 2017 [in the days before his death]\u201d.Wharton felt the inquest did not \u201cutilise the opportunity\u201d to prevent deaths in similar circumstances.A Gold Coast Health spokesperson said the \u201ccoroner found the care provided to this patient was appropriate and made no comments or recommendations\u201d.\u201c The loss of a loved one to suicide is incredibly distressing and we continue to extend our condolences to Josh\u2019s family.\u201dHelping children \u2018discover a way through\u2019Hayley Purdon is a suicide prevention advocate.

Hate, online bullying or photos sent to her house circling her face with red Biro like a target had been unsettling, but not uncommon. This was different.Jones lost 50 pounds, took medical leave from work and watched in disbelief as chunks of her hair started to fall out. Knowing something had to change in the spring of 2023, she filed a lawsuit and wrote her book.That Librarian: The Fight Against Book Banning in America is Jones\u2019s debut memoir, which will be released later this summer. It tells the story of her fight against censorship in the small town she was raised in and of the rise in attacks on librarians and intellectual freedom across the US.\u201cI cried a lot, then decided to fight back,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI hope librarians can read my book and feel like they\u2019re not alone.\u201dJones\u2019s story made international headlines when she became one of the first librarians in the US to file a lawsuit for defamation against those who launched personal attacks on her after she spoke out at a public library board meeting. In July of 2022, when book banning started affecting Livingston parish, where she lived and worked, Jones made a speech against literary censorship at her local public library board. A targeted attacks began shortly thereafter.\u201cOne man posted a picture of me online asking parents how they\u2019d feel if I was giving their kids pornography,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnother made a meme saying I advocate teaching 11-year-olds about anal sex.\u201dThe two men behind these posts and attacks, Michael Lunsford and Ryan Thames, were the focus of the ensuing legal battle.\u201cAll I did was give a delicate speech on censorship,\u201d she said. \u201cThey started posting pages from books I didn\u2019t reference, hadn\u2019t heard of. Awful things spread like wildfire about me around my community.\u201dAcross the country, book banning has been rising at an alarming rate. PEN America documented more than 10,000 bans between 2021 and 2023. Increasingly, school districts or local libraries and their workers are becoming the target of conservative activists and parents.The individuals leveling these bans demand that books with sexual references, themesor discussions of racial conflict be removed from school or public shelves. Frequently, they single out authors of color or those who identify as LGBTQ+.True power, though, is the ability to live rent-free in someone else\u2019s head when you don\u2019t think about them at allWhen Jones first went public with her story, hundreds of other state librarians reached out to describe similar experiences or battles. She decided to join professional boards, conference panels and associations like the American Library Association to speak out about the hate they faced. In 2023, Oprah Winfrey even praised Jones\u2019s work at the National Book Awards.\u201cThe people that harassed me, they still post about me all the time, sometimes five times a day,\u201d Jones said, before adding: \u201cTrue power, though, is the ability to live rent-free in someone else\u2019s head when you don\u2019t think about them at all.\u201d She credits this as her favorite line in the book.Conservative activists continually refer to the people who defend books as \u201cgroomers\u201d, using rhetoric like \u201cpedophiles\u201d and \u201cchild molesters\u201d in their public outcries. Saving the children has become an unfounded, underlying justification for this wave of attacks, which are not just aimed at school librarians but drag storytellers, liberal politicians and authors across the country.The Proud Boys, a regularly violent US extremist group, have been known to attack or protest outside LGBTQ+ themed events at multiple libraries, with instances happening in San Lorenzo, California and New York City.Often, librarians are caught in the middle of these campaigns or hostilities and left to defend their institutions in highly volatile situations. Suzette Baker lost her job as a librarian in Llano county, Texas, in 2022 after she refused to put a copy of Critical Race Theory behind the counter. It\u2019s not just harassment or social media shaming at stake for people in this profession; their jobs and livelihoods are increasingly being put on the line.While Jones was able to turn her situation around and make a success of her experience with the upcoming book, the journey wasn\u2019t easy. Hate still lingers in the community she grew up in and lives in, and she\u2019s lost friends and acquaintances over the rumors that were spread about her.\u201cOne of the chapters is a play on Michelle Obama\u2019s quote: when they go low, you go high,\u201d Jones concluded.\u201cWhen I wrote my story, I tried to go high. I hope that no one harasses the men who harassed me. I just wanted to be honest, truthful, diplomatic.\u201dThat Librarian: The Fight Against Book Banning in America will be published on 27 August."}

It\u2019s a theme \u2013 AI, that is, not the pigeons \u2013 that has been thoroughly mined in cinema of late, perhaps not surprisingly. After all, AI poses one of the more significant threats to the future of humankind. It\u2019s the dystopian sci-fi premise that \u2013 literally \u2013 writes itself, given half the chance. But the eponymous beast in this story is not AI, and Bonello\u2019s approach to the subject is rather more eccentric and original. It\u2019s certainly the most ambitious of his films, which include the fashion biopic Saint Laurent and The House of Tolerance, about a turn-of-the-century Parisian brothel.Elliptical, enigmatic and infused with a luxuriant melancholy, The Beast won\u2019t be for everyone, but submit to its looping structure and beguiling dream logic, and this extremely loose adaptation of a novella by Henry James weaves a bewitching, if a trifle head-swimming spell. (It\u2019s worth mentioning that the same novella, The Beast in the Jungle, was adapted into another film last year, a version that plays out entirely in a nightclub over several decades, directed by Patric Chiha and starring Ana\u00efs Demoustier and Tom Mercier.)Here, a sphinxlike and inscrutable L\u00e9a Seydoux is central to The Beast\u2019s uneasy fascination. She plays the shape-shifting Gabrielle Monnier in three different time periods: a celebrated pianist and society beauty in Paris, 1910; an aspiring model and actor in Los Angeles in 2014. And in 2044, she\u2019s a woman living in an AI-controlled society in which to be fully human is to be a lower-status entity in a world that aspires to be dispassionate, emotionless and as close as possible to the machine ideal.If there is a monster lurking in the shadows of these three linked stories, it\u2019s shapeless, paralysing fearThe Gabrielle of 2044 is an intelligent woman forced to do the most stultifying of drudge work. To get a more challenging and rewarding role, she must submit to a kind of psychic purification process intended to divest her of not just her emotional baggage, but her emotions entirely. This is a world that has been pulled back from the brink of catastrophe, we learn, by ensuring that no decisions are made by people experiencing anger or fear. This seems reasonable enough until you learn that to effect this rule, nobody can feel anything at all.The production and costume design departments work in tandem to create an oppressively tasteful coldness in the look of this section of the picture. Characters dress in emotion-dampening shades of muted beige and taupe; the architecture is all clean lines and no clutter, as though all the personality and individuality has been stripped from the world. Immersed in a bath of what looks like oil \u2013 an image that evokes Jonathan Glazer\u2019s Under the Skin (another film that pushes the sci-fi genre into uncharted territory) \u2013 Gabrielle submits to a robotic probe in her ear and a tour of the trauma accumulated during her past lives.Certain themes and elements become apparent. There\u2019s the pigeon, for a start: a signifier, according to a fortune-teller, of an imminent death in the household. Dolls are another motif, from the flammable celluloid figures of 1910, created in a factory owned by Gabrielle\u2019s husband, to Kelly (Saint Omer star Guslagie Malanda), a slightly sinister android doll companion for Gabrielle in 2044. But the main recurring element is a man named Louis Lewanski, played by George MacKay, acting in French and English with British and American accents.Partying like it\u2019s 2044\u2026 MacKay and Seydoux in The Beast. Photograph: Carole BethuelIn 1910, in an extravagantly ornamental vision of Paris shot on sumptuous 35mm, Gabrielle and Louis are on the brink of a grand affair. But, plagued by premonitions of disaster, Gabrielle can\u2019t quite bring herself to commit. Meanwhile, a great flood threatens to engulf the city and its thwarted lovers.The film\u2019s vision of 2014 is glitchy, terminally online and achingly isolated. Gabrielle, housesitting a luxury modernist pad and failing to get work, spends her time staring, glazed, at her computer screen or dancing alone at a club. Louis is an \u201cincel\u201d, stewing in his sense of injustice and trawling the streets at night looking for fuel for his grievances against women. Once again, their encounter seems doomed to end in tragedy. In 2044, Louis is undergoing the same pre-purification interview process as Gabrielle, and he shows up in a nostalgic nightclub that dedicates itself to the music and fashion of a different era every night \u2013 they meet in 1972, and then again in 1963.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe heady and elusive storytelling of The Beast means that its true nature remains as mercurial as the shifting identities of its central characters. But if there is a monster lurking in the shadows of these three linked stories, it\u2019s the shapeless, paralysing fear that prevents each version of Gabrielle and Louis from accepting and living their truth."}

Meanwhile feature films are being made about Dmitri Shostakovich, George Frideric Han\u00addel, Richard Wagner and Joseph Bologne. Bol\u00e9ro, a film about French composer Maurice Ravel, had its premiere at the International Film Festival Rotterdam earlier this year.The projects follow the Oscar-nominated Maestro, released 18 months ago, in which Bradley Cooper portrayed Leonard Bernstein, the composer and conductor.Christopher Hampton, who won Oscars for Dangerous Liaisons and The Father, has written the screenplay for a new feature film about Shostakovich. Asked why so many film-makers are now looking at the lives of classical composers, he said: \u201cMaybe the film Maestro fed into this a bit. Maybe it made people think you can make such films.\u201cFinanciers are naturally suspicious about anything to do with art. But composers often do lead very interesting lives. It\u2019s not like writing about writers, which is really difficult, as you watch them with a pen and a bit of paper.\u201dDmitri Shostakovich composing, c. 1940s. Photograph: Library of Congress/Getty ImagesHampton has written the screenplay for The Noise of Time, based on Julian Barnes\u2019s novel, a fictionalised retelling of Shostakovich\u2019s life under Stalin that was described by the Observer as a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d. Its story brings out the torment experienced by Shostakovich who, like all Soviet composers, was required to compose music that embraced the ideals of patriotism for \u2018Mother Russia\u2019. With the state watching his every move, he fell foul of the regime.He said: \u201cThe unique thing about him was that he \u2026 chose to stay, rather than becoming an \u00e9migr\u00e9 like all the rest of them. So the story is about an artist trying to work out ways to maintain his integrity while doing what he was told.\u201dHampton, who is rehearsing his latest play, Visit From An Unknown Woman, an adaptation of a Stefan Zweig short story, which will have its English-language premiere at the Hampstead Theatre in north London later this month added: \u201c[Shostakovich] was the adored wunderkind of Russia but, after the act II interval of his opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk \u2013 which had been a huge success \u2013 he looked up at the box and Stalin and the politburo had not come back. Three days later, he was denounced in Pravda.Anthony Hopkins will play Handel, \u2018a genius breaking all the rules\u2019. Photograph: The Observer\u201cThe rest of his life was a misery \u2026 They wouldn\u2019t even give him enough paper. Composers used to have to be issued composition paper from the composers\u2019 union. He turned up one year and they gave him a tenth of what [he] was used to.\u201dThe film, directed by Jan Komasa, will reflect that, despite tragedy and oppression, Shostakovich could never suppress his humour, Hampton said. \u201cHe used to make a toast every New Year\u2019s Eve saying: let\u2019s drink in the hope that things will not get better.\u201d August Diehl, whose acclaimed films include Terrence Malick\u2019s wartime drama A Hidden Life, has been cast as the composer. Andrea Riseborough, who received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of an alcoholic single mother in To Leslie, will play his wife, Nita.A film about Handel, entitled The King of Covent Garden, will star Oscar-winner Sir Anthony Hopkins as the German-born son of a surgeon who became a British citizen in 1727, and is scheduled for release late next year.Its story is set during the period that he worked on his choral master\u00adpiece Messiah. The film-makers describe it as \u201ca powerfully majestic celebration of genius breaking all the rules\u201d.The Ravel film, Bol\u00e9ro, has been sold to 20 countries, while a UK distributor is yet to be found. Warner Classics has released an album of its soundtrack.

He and a member of his security team had a small but important task. They unscrewed a portrait of the queen from the wall. Around them was \u201cincessant gunfire\u201d. Some of it came from heavy calibre weapons. A large TV screen nearby relayed the news on a loop. It was grim. The Taliban were at the gates of Kabul.From time to time, Bristow recalls, there were great crashes from the roof as soldiers destroyed sensitive equipment. The UK was shutting its embassy and relocating to a military facility inside Kabul airport. Soon, soldiers and diplomats would depart. The US-led campaign in Afghanistan \u2013 a 20-year saga of wishful thinking and blunders \u2013 was ending in ignominy and farce. And, as Bristow describes in his compelling memoir Kabul: Final Call, with betrayal and human disaster.British ambassador to Afghanistan Sir Laurie Bristow, second right, at Kabul airport with troops in August 2021. Photograph: FCO/PAThe previous week, the Taliban had overrun a series of provincial capitals. Afghanistan\u2019s foreign-backed republic was falling apart. That might have been predicted. In February 2020, Donald Trump announced the US was pulling its forces out. The Biden administration stuck to this decision and gave a deadline of September 2021 for the exit of Nato troops. Afghanistan\u2019s government, many thought, might stagger on until Christmas.Bristow arrived in Kabul in June 2021, as Afghanistan\u2019s future looked precarious. He understood it might fall to him to shutter the embassy and evacuate staff, as well as Afghans who worked with British forces. What nobody had anticipated was the speed with which the situation unravelled. The Taliban \u2013 chased out in 2001, in the aftermath of 9/11 \u2013 controlled rural areas and key roads. In nine giddy days they reconquered the entire country.What went wrong? As Bristow tells it, the west failed because of bad strategy and a loss of will. After the attacks on the twin towers, a military response from the US and its allies was inevitable. Its goal: to exterminate al-Qaeda. As a young reporter, I watched the Taliban\u2019s northern army surrender outside Mazar-i-Sharif. The five-year-old emirate ended in \u201ca wilderness of shimmering desert and telegraph poles\u201d, I wrote in 2001. It was \u201cvanishing into history\u201d.This prediction turned out to be wrong. After a period in Pakistan\u2019s tribal regions, the Taliban returned. They waged a brutal and increasingly effective insurgency against international and Afghanistan government troops. The conflict cost billions. Meanwhile, George Bush\u2019s administration invaded Iraq. A surge by the next US president, Barack Obama, didn\u2019t bring results. By 2021, the public had lost interest in Afghanistan, seeing it as a for ever war with few benefits.Washington and London\u2019s mistake, in Bristow\u2019s view, was to seek a military solution to what was a political problem. The international coalition also failed to address the \u201cegregious\u201d behaviour of its Afghan allies. Bristow portrays Afghanistan\u2019s then president, Ashraf Ghani, as an aloof academic, surrounded by toadies. As the Taliban closed in, he gave speeches from his fortified Arg palace about digital governance. Afghanistan\u2019s then defence minister, Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, was more clear-eyed; the Taliban tried to murder him. Overall, Afghanistan\u2019s ministers were a corrupt and predatory bunch, beset by factional squabbles.In contrast to his masters in Westminster, Bristow comes across as decent, serious, analytical and quietly heroicBristow is frank about his frustrations in dealing with Whitehall. Some Afghans qualified for resettlement in the UK. But who exactly should make the cut? And what about dependants? The ambassador said he urged the Home Office and Ministry of Defence to speed up the processing of applications, including from his embassy team. Instead of stepping up, officials accused him of \u201ccatastrophising\u201d. \u201cI ignored this,\u201d he writes.As the situation got worse, Bristow received media requests for interviews. He relayed these to special advisers working for then foreign secretary Dominic Raab. There was no reply. When Kabul fell, Raab was on holiday to Crete. Other senior mandarins were missing. Bristow doesn\u2019t say much about the infamous campaign allegedly involving former prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s wife, Carrie, to rescue Afghan cats and dogs. But he notes that \u201cthe priority of some in London\u201d was to spare senior figures from \u201cembarrassment\u201d.Kabul: Final Call is full of glorious details. Bristow was previously ambassador to Moscow. He swapped a 19th-century mansion overlooking the Kremlin for a Barratt Homes-like residence in Kabul. It had a shiny grand piano and a garden with a small lawn and mynah birds. Before flying out, Bristow picked up a flak jacket and helmet. During security alerts, he took cover in a sweaty armoured \u201cwardrobe\u201d and leafed through a back number of the Economist.In the run-up to Kabul\u2019s fall, there were numerous ominous signs. Rockets thudded into the green zone. The French ambassador sent home his chef. After relocating to the airport, Bristow found himself in a \u201creal-life\u201d version of Apocalypse Now, as desperate Afghans tried to board a plane. Thousands besieged the perimeter. The Baron hotel \u2013 used by the UK as an evacuation handling centre \u2013 became a chaotic refugee camp. He spoke to Downing Street from a laptop propped up on the bar.In contrast to his masters in Westminster, Bristow comes across as decent, serious, analytical and quietly heroic: a brave public servant doing a tough job. He pays tribute to the young British soldiers sent to guard the airport\u2019s gates. And to his staff, who had to inform Afghan families they did not qualify for evacuation. \u201cYou are told in return that you are condemning them to death,\u201d he recalls. It was a harrowing experience, he writes, that haunted those involved.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion\u2018A heartbreaking account\u2019: \u00c5sne Seierstad. Photograph: Elin H\u00f8yland/The ObserverSome hoped the Taliban who seized Kabul in 2021 might be more moderate than their hardline predecessors. This, it turned out, was a delusion. The Afghans, by the Norwegian writer and journalist \u00c5sne Seierstad, tells the story of what happened next, after the last flights carrying Bristow and his US counterparts took off. She traces the lives of three Afghans: a Taliban commander, a young female law student and a prominent women\u2019s rights activist.Despite earlier assurances, the Taliban closed down girls\u2019 secondary schools, banned women from the workplace and ordered them to cover up. They were forbidden from travelling farther than 45 miles (72kms) without a male guardian.Seierstad, the bestselling author of The Bookseller of Kabul, gives a heartbreaking account of the first day of school. Senior girls wearing regulation black dresses and white headscarves arrived, keen to learn. They had \u201cexpectant faces\u201d. The same morning, the Taliban\u2019s education ministry ordered female secondary schools to remain closed. In some provinces, Taliban fighters stormed classrooms, beating girls with rods and berating them. In 2022, women were banned from university.It is Afghan women and girls who are paying a terrible price for our missteps. Since the Taliban took power poverty, hunger and infant mortality have soared. Bristow argues we need a \u201cproper reckoning\u201d of why the campaign in Afghanistan ended the way it did. A lack of resolve contributed to Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine, he thinks. The only \u201cglimmer of light\u201d he sees comes from courageous Afghans who defended their right to live freely and in peace.Luke Harding\u2019s Invasion: Russia\u2019s Bloody War and Ukraine\u2019s Fight for Survival, shortlisted for the Orwell prize, is published by Guardian Faber (\u00a310.99) Kabul: Final Call: The Inside Story of the Withdrawal from Afghanistan August 2021 by Laurie Bristow is published by Whittles Publishing (\u00a318.99).

She talks about finding her crowd, her \u2018blunt\u2019 new album, and complicated female friendships", "author": "Kate Mossman", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/02/charli-xcx-interview-brat-360-b2b-club-classics-dutch", "text": "You used to get one shot in the music business: the wrong marketing, the wrong song and you\u2019d never be heard from again. This was not the case for Charlotte Aitchison, better known as Charli XCX, who posted tracks on Myspace so long ago she invited comparisons to Kate Nash. Still just 31, and living between London and LA, she has written countless hits for other people \u2013 Icona Pop\u2019s shouty I Love It, the slinky Se\u00f1orita, sung by Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes \u2013 as well as carving out a niche in experimental pop. Her songs can be brash and bombastic (you might know Boom Clap) but her personal vibe is dry and knowing. Her last record, 2022\u2019s Crash, was a concept album about becoming a mainstream pop star: when it went to No 1, and she scored a song (Speed Drive) on the Barbie soundtrack, it seemed that she\u2019d made it for real.While most people under 30 know very well who she is, much of the world doesn\u2019t, and this strange state of \u201cfamous but not quite\u201d inspired one of the songs on her new album, Brat.She behaves, in some ways, like a megastar. This interview nearly didn\u2019t happen; date after date was proposed and cancelled. She was in London and so was I: I could do wherever, whenever, I said, desperately. When we eventually speak \u2013 on Zoom \u2013 she is in the front seat of a car, on a wobbly phone, in a brown vest with her long hair draped over the seatbelt. She is on the way to try out her PARTYGIRL show at Radio 1\u2019s Big Weekend. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for being difficult,\u201d she says. She is soft, eloquent and deadpan. There is a lot of irony with Charli XCX, but it\u2019s not the occasional raise of an eyebrow \u2013 rather, an almost permanent cast, so consistent that she sounds sincere again. The phone cuts out. It comes back and forth across the M1 to Luton but, eventually, we get there.It took some people who thought quite drastically outside the box to make my ideas reality \u2013 I found that at PC Music\u201cThe industry\u2019s changed a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been told for so long that I\u2019m an outsider and I never really felt accepted into the British music scene. The press has perpetuated that narrative of me. I\u2019m this girl who straddles the underground and pop music, and that, for some reason, is really difficult for some people to wrap their heads around.\u201dCharli XCX says she has always thrived on the idea of living a double life. She is half Indian and half English, for a start: her mother, Shameera, came from a Gujarati family in Uganda, forced to flee in the 1970s under the regime of Idi Amin. Weekends were spent with Nana and Appa in Crawley, watching Bollywood films, but she knows no Gujarati other than the phrase for \u201churry up\u201d (\u201cjaldi-jaldi!\u201d). She thinks she wasn\u2019t taught it because her mother had had a difficult transition to the UK: once, someone threw a milkshake over her in the street.Charli XCX, centre, in the video for her song 360. Photograph: YouTubeOn the one hand, the teenage Aitchison was \u201cuncool\u201d at school, on the other she was listening to Justice and 2ManyDJs, dreaming of making dance music. At 15, she announced she was leaving home to live with a man she\u2019d met on Myspace who promoted illegal raves. Her parents were relieved when she went off this idea, and just asked to play the raves instead. She recently found flyers for the Peanut Factory in Hackney Wick and the Resistance Gallery in Bethnal Green, some of her earliest shows in 2008 in London. As she was underage, her mum and dad came with her, and kept at some distance in the crowd, her \u201cwild child\u201d businessman father reliving his youth.She blagged her way into the Slade School of Fine Art \u2013 \u201cNot to take away from the artists who attend art school, but I do think that a lot of it is about the gift of the gab\u201d \u2013 but she struggled with its traditional environment, dropping out after the first year. \u201cI found it very intimidating,\u201d she says. \u201cI just felt like a loser the whole time. I didn\u2019t feel eloquent enough, I didn\u2019t feel well-read enough.\u201d The experience was good practice, though, for stepping up to the next level in the music industry. \u201cYou\u2019re around people who are a lot older than you, who will tell you that they\u2019re right and you\u2019re wrong. I think going to art school and facing that in a lower-stakes environment was helpful, because it taught me to stand up for myself.\u201dWhile still at the Slade, Aitchison did a piece of performance art dressed as Britney Spears, lip-syncing to \u2026Baby One More Time in front of some Justin Bieber posters. That was 2010: then, in 2013, there was her debut album, True Romance, which, while critically acclaimed, sold, in her words, \u201caround 12 copies\u201d.You can\u2019t understand Charli XCX without understanding the scene she then immersed herself in for the better part of a decade: the label PC Music, which housed Danny L Harle, Hannah Diamond, GFOTY and others, many with very strange names. The label was the brainchild of Goldsmiths graduate AG Cook, who once claimed he was promoting people who didn\u2019t usually make music and \u201ctreating them as if they were major label artists\u201d. In pop\u2019s metaverse, where everything has been done before, PC Music made Technicolor postmodern \u201chyperpop\u201d inspired by early 2000s eurodance, full of nostalgic references to the earliest days of the internet (the \u201cXCX\u201d comes from the name Charli used on Messenger when she was a pupil at Bishop\u2019s Stortford College).On stage in Arizona, 2018. Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty ImagesThe label, which stopped releasing new music last year, transcended genre, its heavy use of Auto-Tune and pitch-shift turning some of its singers into childlike, otherworldly avatars. \u201cThus far,\u201d says Aitchison, \u201cany collaborators I\u2019d worked with had at points thought of my ideas as silly or childish, or not eloquent. It took some people who were willing to think quite drastically outside the box to make those ideas reality, and that was what I found in PC Music.\u201dI hate the LA approach to songwriting that starts with a kind of therapy session\u2026 it produces very flaccid songs in my opinion The most famous artist (beyond Charli XCX) affiliated to the label was Sophie, the Scottish producer whose songs (such as Lemonade, or Hard) set cosmically cute voices on emotive, abrasive melodies. Sophie died in 2021 after falling from the roof of her apartment while trying to see a full moon. She is the subject of the tender, halting song So I, on Brat, which contrasts her warmth and humanity with Charli\u2019s reticence (\u201cYou said come on stay for dinner / I said no I\u2019m fine\u201d). Sophie produced Vroom Vroom, one of those \u201cchildish\u201d ideas for a song: \u201cI said: \u2018I want to write a song about fast cars and I want the track to feel chaotic, but sexy and fun and dark, all at once.\u2019 Sophie totally understood that.\u201d\u201cPeople were so perplexed by PC Music, but it\u2019s unbelievably simple as a concept,\u201d she concludes. \u201cAll of the people who are signed to the label, their character is very similar to the music they release. It\u2019s just a jacked-up, amped-up version of the real person. People thought it was a gimmick \u2013 \u2018Oh, these people aren\u2019t really like that\u2019 \u2013 but they are!\u201dI first met Charli XCX six years ago, making a radio show for the World Service about this developing cult pop star. She was already based in LA much of the time \u2013 living out of a suitcase but always in a five-star hotel. She was tired, and sulky, but she turned up for work. She told me she\u2019d had media training early in her career, \u201cbut the teacher said I was the worst person she\u2019d ever encountered. I actually think I\u2019m a great interview.\u201dShe was, in a way. One of the most commonly asked questions of musicians who write songs for other people is whether they wish they\u2019d kept hit songs for themselves. \u201cIf I don\u2019t keep a track, it\u2019s because I don\u2019t like it,\u201d she said bluntly. Could she tell when something was going to be a hit? \u201cNever.\u201d Her worst nightmare, she told me, would be someone hearing what she sounds like without Auto-Tune: when she\u2019s in the booth, with the cans on and the software pulling her voice up to the right pitch, she is in her happy place. But if you were listening in the room it would sound \u201ccrazy. I mean crazy. I have to say: I can\u2019t sing but trust me it will be good.\u201dWith her fiance, George Daniel, drummer of the 1975. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage for Vanity FairIt was hard to work out what kind of a pop star she was. At her show the following week, at London\u2019s Village Underground, fans had queued from 6am: one was doing his master\u2019s degree on PC Music. The gig was a giant dance party for the initiated: she hosted dozens of other acts on stage.These days, Charli XCX is part of an LA scene \u2013 along with Caroline Polacheck and Christine and the Queens, with whom she\u2019s collaborated \u2013 where some of the most experimental sounds are being made. Her wonderfully strange lockdown album, How I\u2019m Feeling Now, was nominated for a Mercury prize, and she is uniquely placed at the intersection of pop and alternative music. Last month a satirical video for her latest single, 360, featuring Julia Fox, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Hari Nef and other immaculate female celebrities, imagined a quest to find \u201cthe new hot internet girl\u201d. Also present is Gabbriette, lead singer of the all-girl punk band Nasty Cherry, which Charli put together for the 2019 Netflix docuseries. The video locates her at the cutting edge of internet culture. It is almost designed to make people like me feel old.\u201cMore than ever now, people are rewarding the niche,\u201d says Aitchison. \u201cFinally, it seems fine that I\u2019m just myself, and suddenly people like it. It\u2019s good to finally be accepted. I\u2019m happy with the winding path I\u2019ve taken, and with my status as more of an outsider, because sometimes I feel a bit awkward being in the club. I\u2019m at peace with it all. It\u2019s all cool.\u201dShe now lives in the Hollywood Hills, in a house formerly owned by Scottish DJ-producer Calvin Harris, and is engaged to George Daniel, drummer of the 1975. In a music world ruled by one or two artists who barely speak to the press, Aitchison\u2019s directness is invaluable. \u201cI hate the traditional LA approach to songwriting,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving a kind of therapy session at the beginning, talking about what is going on in your life, then turning a sentence or two of that into a song \u2013 that\u2019s my nightmare way of writing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt produces very flaccid songs in my opinion.\u201dFor Brat, she has worked with few co-writers other than her old friend AG Cook. \u201cI\u2019ve always been very blunt. I\u2019ve taken one step forward and two steps back in terms of being secure in who I am as a person, but I think that\u2019s just a human thing. Right now, there\u2019s this alchemy where I\u2019ve somehow been drawn to making a club record \u2013 which feels intrinsically who I am \u2013 coupled with this new lyrical style. It\u2019s very much like texts I would send to friends. I wasn\u2019t worried about rhyme, or the traditional things; it\u2019s really just about capturing a feeling of chaos and saying the most blunt thing that is at the top of my brain.\u201dOne day you can feel completely on top of the world; the next, you can feel like your career\u2019s overThe album was named in tribute to the unabashed me-centric nature of internet culture, which she both satirises and plays into. It is an unusually intimate record, full of Sophie-inspired minimalism: the tracks that work best are so personal it feels like you\u2019re eavesdropping. Take Girl, So Confusing, which centres on a female friend whose intentions she can\u2019t figure out: \u201cAre you waiting to watch me fall?\u201d The track seems to expand the conversation about female solidarity into a more genuine emotional space, acknowledging how complicated relationships between women can be. \u201cI\u2019m glad you put that so eloquently, because I suppose I\u2019ve been nervous that people would just think that I\u2019m being a real bitch,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve said is totally right, and I wish we could just quote you.\u201d Charli XCX is having fun with me.\u201cWe\u2019ve got past the point of the media always pitting women against one another,\u201d she continues. \u201cIn the mid to late 00s, it literally sold magazines and papers: \u2018Britney versus Christina\u2019, \u2018Paris versus Lindsay\u2019. Then feminism became a popular marketing tool. In the music industry, it was distilled into this idea that if you support women, and you like other women, then you\u2019re a good feminist. The reverse of that is, if you don\u2019t like all other women who exist and breathe on this Earth then you\u2019re a bad feminist. If you\u2019re not a girl\u2019s girl then you\u2019re a bad woman.\u201cThat\u2019s just such an unrealistic expectation of women,\u201d she says. \u201cRelationships between women are super-complex and multi-layered. You can like someone and dislike them at the same time; you can feel jealous of somebody but they can still be your friend; you can have the best time of your life on a night out with someone but not be that close to them at all. You can pose with your arms around a person at an awards show, but in reality you\u2019re feeling not worthy, or small \u2013 or really cocky, or confident, or a huge multitude of different emotions. One day you can feel completely on top of the world; the next day, you can feel like your career\u2019s over. The song is saying, sometimes it\u2019s really confusing to be a girl, and that\u2019s fine.\u201dIt\u2019s hard work being a pop star these days. You must be across every part of your image \u2013 design, message, photography, stagecraft. You have to be able to manage your fans with the right level of intimacy while also keeping the boundaries, because fans, and internet culture, are literally making you what you are. \u201cWe used to live in a time where artists could live in a vacuum,\u201d she says. \u201cYou could have a great song, even a great album, and not be super-immersed in gossip culture. The internet has broken the distance that a lot of artists used to have. What gets me interested in an artist is when they have \u2013 not really a backstory, it\u2019s more like lore...\u201dWhen I met her six years ago, Aitchison was holding a \u201clistening party\u201d in Gloucester Road, at which she consulted fans for advice on her next album. Around 15 people under 20 came to a room, with a table set out with crisps and sweets. She played new tracks and asked whether they should be singles. \u201cWhat do you think of the drop? Is it too late? Should I keep this song for myself or give it to someone else?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s very you,\u201d said one boy, and she accepted it, slightly taken aback. Her lockdown album was also written with an \u201copen\u201d production process, consulting fans on creative decisions, and in 2022 it all got too much when some of them came down hard on her for the singles she chose from Crash. She didn\u2019t fight back, just left Twitter for a while. \u201cThese days, labels are really desperate for their artists to be liked, and the currency of niceness is really important in selling records, otherwise you\u2019re bad, evil and wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t separate yourself from your fans. Unless it\u2019s extremely drastic and distant \u2013 and then that almost becomes the culture itself...\u201dYou can almost hear the cogs working, as Charli XCX starts to imagine a new kind of pop star.\u201cPersona is intrinsic to the modern-day artist, unless you completely reject it and do something alien-like and cold... I can\u2019t wait for somebody to do that, actually. I can\u2019t wait for someone to be really cold and mean and icy. But we\u2019re not in a place where any major artist could do that. I hope someone dares.\u201dA cold, alien pop star, who disdains their fans?\u201cYeah, how fun, how fabulous. I\u2019m up for that.\u201d"}

This discretion is not limited to Australian citizens.Don Rothwell, an international law expert at the Australian National University, says this \u201cremarkable provision\u201d suggests the attorney general\u2019s view can\u2019t be challenged in court.Rothwell says the provision is \u201csufficiently broad that the attorney general could exercise such a discretion to ensure that an ICC arrest warrant is not acted upon in the case of certain persons where the Australian government of the day took the view that the arrest warrant had no merit\u201d.\u201cIt was sufficient for the Howard government to win over doubters in the party room and Australia became an original party to the Rome Statute on its entry into force on 1 July 2002,\u201d Rothwell says.The issue has roared back onto the domestic political agenda in the past two weeks after the ICC\u2019s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan KC, announced he was seeking arrest warrants for two Israeli leaders and three Hamas leaders.Khan said he had \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d Netanyahu and the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, bore criminal responsibility for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, including \u201cstarvation of civilians as a method of warfare\u201d.The Israeli government has rejected the allegations, arguing the move amounts to an attempt to deny the country\u2019s right of self defence to the Hamas attacks of 7 October.An Israeli government spokesperson called on allies such as Australia to \u201coppose the prosecutor\u2019s decision and declare that, even if warrants are issued, you do not intend to enforce them\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dutton, now opposition leader, has called for Australia to apply \u201cpressure\u201d on the ICC not to proceed.The Albanese government has responded cautiously, but a spokesperson for the foreign minister, Penny Wong, says it is important that international law is upheld.\u201cSince John Howard ratified the Rome Statute in 2002, Australia has respected the International Criminal Court.\u201d"}

I felt so isolated. He would question \u2018what are you doing?\u2019 and say \u2018if you dare go out, I\u2019ll get you killed\u2019,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia of the months before the trip.That trip would also allow her to re-enter Australia on a new tourist visa, before the one she held expired and while she waited for her partner visa application to be assessed.But the day before they were due to fly out, her husband \u2013 an Australian citizen \u2013 left their home and didn\u2019t return. After hours of waiting, she says she received a break-up text from him \u2013 and a warning to leave the country.Priya says that with her visa about to expire, she believed she had no option but to depart Australia. So after reaching Thailand, she flew back to her home country in south Asia.Amid a spate of horrific domestic violence killings in Australia, migration and trafficking experts say there is a hidden crisis where women, typically those already subject to domestic violence, are tricked, threatened or forced into leaving Australia. Technically called exit trafficking, the practice is illegal and is treated as a form of people trafficking under commonwealth law.Last financial year alone, the Australian federal police received 30 reports of exit trafficking. But research has estimated only 20% of human trafficking and slavery cases in Australia are detected.In April, the first Victorian to be charged with exit trafficking was found guilty by a jury of leaving his wife stranded in South Sudan without her passport. He flew back with the couple\u2019s children and it took his wife two years to return to Australia. He faces 12 years behind bars.\u2018Nothing I could do\u2019Speaking via an interpreter, Lee* says she was trafficked out of Australia by her then husband last year.She says the man, an Australian citizen, told her they needed to return to her home country for a few months because her mother-in-law\u2019s visa was about to expire.But he had only booked a one-way ticket for Lee.\u201cI was suspicious but there was nothing I could do,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone here.\u201dA few months after returning to south Asia, Lee contacted a health service that she had used in Australia and was eventually connected to InTouch, a family violence service for migrant and refugee women. InTouch helped her return to Australia and get permanent residency.Lina Garcia Daza, who leads the Australian Red Cross\u2019s federally funded Support for Trafficked People program, says it received 16 referrals for exit trafficking last year. Almost 90% of clients referred to the program after experiencing exit trafficking are women.The program provides a range of support including financial assistance, accommodation, medical treatment, counselling and referrals to legal and migration assistance.\u201cSafety is a big issue. Usually they are escaping a situation of violence. They may arrive in Australia fearful of authorities and of reprisal, especially if they have dependent children,\u201d she says.\u201cThey arrive to the country again, knowing they may not be able to go to the same neighbourhood where they used to live or for their children to attend the same school. It\u2019s usually a big challenge.\u201dAn AFP spokesperson said over the past five years, Australia has seen an overall annual increase in the number of exit trafficking reports. In the 2018-19 financial year there were just 13 reported cases.The spokesperson said prosecuting exit trafficking cases presents a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d to the AFP due to the under-reporting of crimes, which is exacerbated by victims\u2019 lack of awareness of their rights under Australian law, fear of retribution, and language barriers.\u201cAdditionally the prosecution process is hindered by legal and evidentiary hurdles including issues such as evidence collection from other nations and the reliance on victim testimony, which can be challenging to obtain,\u201d the spokesperson said.Visa abuseOnce abroad some victim-survivors contact Australian authorities, including the Department of Home Affairs, the AFP or a consulate, in search of help.Others may never make it back to Australia.Priya spent months researching her legal rights before flying back to Australia on a tourist visa \u2013 determined to stay in the country she had begun to think of as home. She returned with only the suitcase she had left with and her identity documents.A chance encounter with a family violence worker in a Melbourne park led her to be connected to accommodation and legal support.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In recent years the legal centre has seen more sophisticated techniques of visa abuse, including the perpetrators controlling a person\u2019s online immigration portal, allowing them to manipulate their dependent\u2019s visa outcome without the victim knowing.\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to hear the perpetrator provide misinformation such as \u2018to get your visa, you have to stay with me\u2019,\u201d she says.\u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of misinformation. It sounds very convincing. And they say it in such a way that they\u2019re consistently providing this information so that they believe all of that.\u201dProtection for temporary visa holdersOnly select visas in Australia, including the partner visa, have family violence provisions for applicants, meaning there is a pathway to permanent residency if a person can demonstrate their sponsor perpetrated violence against them during their relationship.\u201c[Priya] is actually one of the more fortunate clients that we have been able to assist, in terms of legal options available to her,\u201d Vejar says.She says the legal centre has advocated for a temporary family violence visa and for family violence provisions to be extended to all visa categories as well as for the Department of Home Affairs to communicate with all visa applicants over the age of 18, to ensure they know what is happening with their application.Anti-Slavery Australia, a human rights centre at the University of Technology Sydney that runs a legal practice, identified the first case of exit trafficking that resulted in prosecution in 2017, after a referral from a community agency..It resulted in the AFP laying charges that led to the first conviction of exit trafficking in Australia in 2021.Prof Jennifer Burn, director of Anti-Slavery Australia, says exit trafficking is particularly invisible when it occurs within domestic relationships.\u201cThis might be in the circumstances of a foreign national sponsored to Australia on a partner visa, who is then trafficked overseas at a later point.\u201d she says.\u201cThe widespread lack of awareness around exit trafficking means that this cohort is unlikely to know that what they have experienced is a crime and that they have rights and entitlements under Australian law,\u201d she says.Burn, a law professor at UTS, says the most common form of exit trafficking the organisation has seen is cases of young female Australian citizens and residents trafficked overseas for a forced marriage.\u201cWe have also seen a rise in women being trafficked overseas by their intimate partners. Generally these women are on temporary visas or partner visas,\u201d she says.Priya was recently granted permanent residency and is now focused on rebuilding her life in Australia with hopes of studying migration law one day.\u201cI want to help people who are trapped in this complex system.

They are now surviving off charity.\u201cWe came to Australia in 2009 with my wife and until February 2024 I have had full-time work rights with no issue,\u201d Singh said. \u201cAll that time \u2013 14 years.\u201dSingh said his visa was set to expire and he was required to submit an application to renew it, which he did before the due date. \u201cOn time \u2013 no issues,\u201d he said.But he said the immigration department did not process his application until two days later \u2013 after the due date. \u201cSo I was illegal for that period,\u201d Singh said.\u201cWe gave them the evidence. They agreed but said it was the system [and] they could not do much about it.

As he was the sole bread winner for his family, they were evicted. They were forced to live in a tent.Singh sold their belongings \u2013 a phone, a laptop and a car \u2013 and along with some money from the local Sikh community the family was able to pay for three months\u2019 rent on a property in Caroline Springs in Melbourne\u2019s west.

Food we are getting from Sikh community, but [we can\u2019t afford] other stuff.\u201cWith the kids, it\u2019s hard to give them an answer every day \u2013 it\u2019d be hard to explain to them.\u201dCarina Ford, an immigration lawyer, is representing Singh and said the case was now before the minister, which is the family\u2019s last resort.Ford said Singh lost his working rights because he was deemed to have had a \u201cperiod of unlawfulness\u201d.\u201cNot due to their fault \u2013 due to the department not processing the bridging visa on time,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, they\u2019ve been put on a bridging visa with no work rights.\u201cThat\u2019s because the legislation says you must not have a period of unlawfulness, even if it\u2019s not your fault.\u201dFord said the family had requested compensation, but it would not cover what was needed to continue paying rent and the family could be waiting months to hear back about their case.\u201cThey can grant them a bridging visa under another ground, which would enable work rights, which is what they used to do in the past,\u201d Ford said.Ford said there were \u201csystemic issues\u201d with how long it took to grant bridging visas.\u201cWe spend a lot of our time chasing up the department granting bridging visas, because they just can\u2019t keep up with the processing.\u201cThis is a pretty unfair result. The system is such that if you get strict interpretation, you\u2019re left with issues like this.\u201dThe Department of Home Affairs has not responded to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for comment.Singh said he had only $25 in his bank account and he was not sure what the family would do. They are worried they may have to leave Australia to go back to India, even though two of their children were born in Australia and became citizens after their 10th birthdays.\u201cWe\u2019re worried about leaving Australia because we have been living here 14 years.

When that gambit failed, Origin set an August 2025 closing date \u2013 seven years earlier than scheduled prior to the extension, dimming prospects for Eraring\u2019s 230-odd employees.Despite the uncertainty, King, who is a delegate with the Mining and Energy Union, says he knows of only one person who left the plant for another job. He cites a survey predicting workers leaving the sector would cop a 60% to 70% pay cut: \u201cTo face that is quite confronting.\u201dEraring, which supplies one-fifth of NSW\u2019s electricity, is now obliged to generate half that share \u2013 or 6 terawatt-hours a year \u2013 until August 2027. It may then run for another 20 months but without state support.The period of limbo will linger for many in the Lake Macquarie region, including green groups who fear the legacy of Eraring\u2019s 35m tonne coal ash dam, and authorities and firms working to prime the economy for a post-coal future in one of Australia\u2019s fastest growing population centres 120km from Sydney.\u2018On the scrap heap\u2019Intervention by the Minns Labor government may have granted Eraring a temporary reprieve but so far there is no reprieve for 1,000 workers at the two nearby coalmines.Origin is negotiating with Centennial Coal over contracts expiring at the end of June.

Instead, Mach Energy\u2019s Mt Pleasant and New Hope\u2019s Bengalla mines in the Hunter Valley look set to fill the void.Myuna\u2019s staff and many at Mandalong now \u201chave got no idea where they will go in four weeks\u2019 time\u201d, Land says. Car loans and mortgages too will be in jeopardy.Origin posted a 17-fold increase in profit and secured a deal for the state to absorb 80% of any Eraring losses \u2013 as much as $450m \u2013 for two years. It now wants to squeeze miners, says Belinda Giblin, lead organiser of the Collieries\u2019 Staff & Officials Association.\u201cDo they have to have a social conscience and accept that there is a cost to doing business and [do] the right thing?\u201d Giblin says.An Origin spokesperson says negotiations with Centennial are \u201congoing and we are hopeful of reaching an outcome. It would be wrong to imply a commercial outcome can\u2019t be reached.\u201dGuardian Australia understands rival mines are offering prices Centennial will struggle to match. Government data estimated Myuna\u2019s coal price as about $175/tonne and Mandalong\u2019s $297/t, and officials say they won\u2019t interfere with Eraring\u2019s commercial decisions.Other interventions \u2013 or their absence \u2013 will be closely watched by environmentalists.Belinda Giblin: \u2018Do they have to have a social conscience and accept that there is a cost to doing business and [do] the right thing?\u2019 Photograph: Brydie Piaf/The Guardian\u2018Health and environmental risk\u2019Abigail Boyd, the Greens MP who initiated a 2019 upper house inquiry into remediation of coal ash dams including Eraring\u2019s, says the government has a \u201cconflict of interest within themselves\u201d.Tighter regulation of pollution entering the environment via smoke stacks or the ash dump will increase plant costs.

Selenium, lead and mercury are other contaminants.An EPA spokesperson says the agency is \u201cworking on a comprehensive and independent assessment of environmental impacts of coal ash dams\u201d. It expects to release its finding by mid-2024, including monitoring of the lake\u2019s water quality.Health minister Ryan Park said NSW Health was \u201cworking closely with partner agencies to assess the impact of this on the health of communities, and I look forward to reviewing their findings in due course\u201d.NSW Health commissioned a review of environmental data to determine whether people living close to power stations and coal ash dams \u201cwere exposed to potentially hazardous chemicals through air, water, soil or local fish and seafood\u201d.\u201cThe Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water has prepared a draft report on possible pathways and likelihood of exposure to coal ash and other pollutants of concern,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding the report would be subject to further community consultation when completed in coming months.Coal ash needn\u2019t remain in the landscape forever. It can be reused as an ingredient for concrete and road foundations, an economic activity encouraged by David Antcliff, director of development at the Lake Macquarie city council.Planning restrictions often curb councils\u2019 ability to grow but Antcliff says his region has \u201cenough zoned land for housing for the next 20 years\u201d. Rather, the council is desperate to access land for industry \u2013 such as for offshore windfarm developers \u2013 to generate jobs once the mines and power stations close.\u201cMining lands is actually the big story here,\u201d he says. These occupy thousands of hectares that \u201cfor decades and decades had provided a huge amount of economic prosperity \u2026 but that\u2019s very much coming to an end and very soon\u201d.Complicated rules have slowed their repurposing, in some cases by two decades.\u201cIt\u2019s illogical for me to be approving development applications on virgin bushland and knocking it down when I\u2019ve got disturbed industrial land next door that\u2019s literally having trees grown on it,\u201d Antcliff said.The region\u2019s \u201ctest case\u201d is the Black Rock Motor Resort atop a former Rhondda underground colliery dormant since 1970, being developed by Tony Palmer.The $95m race track, Australia\u2019s second-longest at 5.25km, will have luxury accommodation, a function centre and provide more than 220 jobs when it opens in June 2026. Electric vehicles and innovative fuels will feature in the project.\u201cWith all of the incentives that are thrown in the directions of the miners, there\u2019s zero coming back over the fence to the developers that have a vision,\u201d Palmer says. Attempts at seeking support are \u201cjust not worth the paper it\u2019s written on and a waste of air\u201d."}

Last week the Productivity Commission released a report into inequality in Australia, and it showed that during the pandemic their disposable income shot up.And the divide is stark.

The works range from $15,000 to $40,000.\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a real depth of collectors happy to spend at those levels,\u201d Reid says.\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing a slowdown at all in that premier price range.\u201dIn boutiques, at the high-end stores on Melbourne\u2019s Collins St and Sydney\u2019s Castlereagh St, the story is similar.Last year more than $1bn was spent on luxury fashion.In 2023 the Australian arm of Herm\u00e8s, which operates just six stores across the country, made $477.13m \u2013 a bump of 23%. That\u2019s a $90m jump in a single year.Chanel recorded sales of $598.5m, up 4.8%.A Bain & Co report revealed luxury sales were up 6% in Australia for the year, following a global trend of 8% \u2013 or $2.5tn.\u2018$8,000 to $16,000 in a few years\u2019As the profits of fashion houses go up so do the prices of their bags.\u201cChanel and Herm\u00e8s, all luxury houses, they increase prices two, sometimes three times a year,\u201c Leung says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not talking small amounts but 20% or 30% at a time.\u201dHe says one of Chanel\u2019s small classic flaps has gone up from $8,000 to $16,000 in a a few years.

Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianA former staff member at Chanel in Sydney, who spoke to Guardian Australia under the condition of anonymity, says their clients spend hundreds and thousands each year and often come in every two to three weeks. \u201cTop spenders might get to see collections early and reserve pieces, but this is for a very small number of clients.\u201d\u2018Playing the game\u2019Social media is fuelling the luxury handbag market.No one needs to be told the bags themselves \u2013 the material and labour \u2013 do not cost their price tag. In the world of TikToker Tanner Leatherstein, whose real name is Volkan Yilmaz, these bags are sliced and diced in seconds to reveal their true quality.One video starts with Yilmaz slashing a Louis Vuitton Go-14 Pico, worth $6,700; in another he dissects a Capucines MM \u2013 a casual $11,300. Prada is on the chopping block, so is Yves Saint Laurent. He then tells his 950,000 followers how much the bag likely costs to make.\u201cThe price multipliers I see in the luxury brand space vary between 10x to 20x so far,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a bag costs $250 in leather, hardware and assembly and labour, it is sold between $2,500 and $5,000.\u201dAs the profits of fashion houses go up, so do the prices of their bags. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianThe bags with the deepest lore sell for the most. Grace Kelly was first photographed with her namesake bag to hide her pregnancy. To get a Birkin, prospective buyers have to spend an unknown amount at a Herm\u00e8s store and build a relationship with a Herm\u00e8s sales assistant \u2013 only then they might be put on the list \u2013 where they\u2019ll wait sometimes years.Stories fly around of people who have got them, or tried to. One woman\u2019s husband spent an unknown amount only to bring it home for her and she didn\u2019t like it; another husband bought so many things in a bid to reach the unknown amount that he bought something for a dog he didn\u2019t own; another woman went to Paris, won the lottery for a \u201cleather appointment\u201d \u2013 an instore meeting with an assistant \u2013 and was only offered a size 28 when she had her heart set on a 25.Online there are endless articles and videos offering tips to high flyers on how to get the bag. This level of exclusivity is what drives the sales, Leung says.Some of their customers come in just to avoid this.\u201cThere\u2019s people that don\u2019t want to play the game,\u201d Leung says. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to wait for the queue. And they\u2019ll just come to a place like ours and just get the Birkin straight up.\u2018Honestly, they\u2019ve got the money\u2019The Purse Affair sits at the flat end of Collins Street but still exudes high society. The staff offer water when you arrive, the chandeliers cast soft white light across the shelves and flowers are placed next to Louis Vuitton trunks in the entryway.Leung says a lot of high-end buyers use consignment stores to sell bags they bought two or three years ago \u2013 because the prices increase so quickly they can often break even or get most of the money back.Shop owner Alex Leung with the Birkin. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianCollecting is different \u2013 many clients will upscale, selling their Gucci or Louis Vuitton to get a Chanel or their Chanel to get a Herm\u00e8s. Leung says they know what their customers want, and they will often source the bags from overseas for them.\u201cLet\u2019s go back to scarcity. Even if you are very rich, often it\u2019s very hard to get the exact thing that you want.\u201cIt\u2019s easier just to go to the resale world or the personal shopper world, and companies like mine, so that you can straight away just get what you want.\u201dLeung says during Covid, like many high-end consignment stores, they recorded more customers. Instead of travelling, people with disposable incomes bought handbags. That wave has ebbed but the market catering to the top end of town is still thriving.\u201cIt is resilient,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can still hit up clients with a $50,000 offer and they\u2019ll be able to make a decision in a split second. Because honestly, they\u2019ve got the money.\u201d"}

One that\u2019s abridged, and feels safe to share; blurred round the edges. \u201cWhat I do for work today,\u201d she begins, \u201crequires a lot of public speaking. I\u2019m used, therefore, to telling a light version of my history. One for inspiration, or whatever. How I\u2019ve had a lot of experience of being the outsider: the only one, the first. I was the first Black woman to swim for Great Britain; the only Black person in my year doing my degree at Oxford University. I\u2019m often the sole Black woman in the corporate rooms that I\u2019m in today. That bit is easy \u2013 the top line, and quite divorced from me.\u201dIt\u2019s Friday lunchtime in her literary agent\u2019s airy West End office. A copy of her new memoir, These Heavy Black Bones, sits on the table between us. It documents the dedication demanded of a young athlete; the sacrifice and strain that comes with competing at the highest of levels. It\u2019s vulnerable and exposing. She\u2019s 30 now. Half her lifetime ago, at the age of 15, Ajulu-Bushell was ranked as the top short-course 50m female breaststroker internationally, of any age. In the run up to London 2012, aged 17, at what should have been the pinnacle of her swimming career, Ajulu-Bushell walked away from her sport, never to return. She writes of the toll it took to be the first; the cost of chasing peak performance. \u201cSpeaking about the detail feels more like shaky ground,\u201d she says, tentatively. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure I feel ready. Part of me just wants to run away.\u201dFor most of the intervening years, she resolved not to return to these sporting experiences. \u201cThen Covid happened and everyone felt the world was ending. You revisited things. And I was in the midwest of America at the time working on a PhD, which I never finished. George Floyd was murdered, not that far away. The Black Lives Matter movement reemerged. Alice Dearing had just qualified for the Tokyo 2021 \u2013 the first Black woman to swim for TeamGB at an Olympic Games. It had been 10 years since I stopped. Articles were written that talked about me: that I was going to be the first before I quit the Olympic team. My name being in the press again was a reminder of something I\u2019d put behind me.\u201dAjulu-Bushell did a TV interview with Sky Sports that same year, for Black History month. \u201cI talked about how racism still exists in all sports at elite level and in mine specifically.\u201d Soon, she began writing. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to write,\u201d she says, \u201cand this felt the place to start.\u201d A novel in the works already, long term, she hopes to write fiction. \u201cFirst I wanted to suck the poison out, to see if I could.\u201dFrom an early age, the signs of Ajulu-Bushell\u2019s future success were there. \u201cSwimming always felt easier than walking,\u201d she says. \u201cAt school in Nairobi \u2013 I would have been six \u2013 I had this great swimming teacher. She wrote in my reports: \u2018Rebecca will be a swimming star of the future.\u2019\u201d Her first competition was a small inter-school gala. She won every race she entered. \u201cI went home and drew a picture of a little brown girl in a swimming costume with a comically large gold medal around her neck. \u2018Mum,\u2019 I said, \u2018this is me when I win the Olympics.\u2019\u201d\u2018They were always watching us\u2019: Rebecca Achieng Ajulu-Bushell. Photograph: Kate Peters/The ObserverBorn in Warrington, it was in Nairobi that Ajulu-Bushell spent the longest stretch of her childhood. Her mother and stepfather were humanitarian aid workers, which meant regular relocation. There were stints in Uganda, Malawi and South Africa, alongside the Kenyan capital. When she was 10, the family landed in Cape Town. \u201cI had these two crazy Eastern Bloc coaches,\u201d she says, \u201cand much more resources than in Kenya. The swimming stepped up, hugely. It becomes your whole life overnight. The hours-in are astounding. You need these hours in a pool to train your body to develop in a certain way. No one sits you down to sign away your childhood. Suddenly, you\u2019re in a world where the intensity and sacrifice are normalised entirely.\u201dWhen Ajulu-Bushell was 13, her parents planned a return to Nairobi. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep my training up there,\u201d she says, \u201cand my parents realised their lives couldn\u2019t fit five more years of my schedule. I was sent to a boarding school in Plymouth. There are lots of sports schools in the UK, set up to create mini high-performance centres for children. I was on this really intense swimming programme.\u201d About 24 children, aged 13-18, lived and trained together. \u201cMy childhood was in East and South Africa,\u201d she says. \u201cI was barefoot, climbing trees with no makeup. Then I arrived in Devon, 2007. The culture shock? It was insane.\u201d Then came the swimming.The daily routine: alarms went off at 4.45 every morning. In the pool from 5:15am, they\u2019d swim for two and a half hours. \u201cWe\u2019d do 8 to 10km,\u201d she explains, \u201cbefore heading to school for breakfast. We\u2019d eat as much as possible. We were burning so many calories that we were starving, all the time.\u201d After a day spent in classes with the wider year group, they returned, again, to training. \u201cAnother two-hour session. Then dinner at school, an hour of weights and gym training, before going back to the boarding house for homework, packing and unpacking, endless costume drying. By the time you were done, it was past 11pm. Then at 4.45am you\u2019d start it all again.\u201dAnd if you fancied a lie in?\u201cNo no no,\u201d she interrupts. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen. You never miss training. Never. If you did miss the morning, you weren\u2019t allowed to train in the evening. It sounds like a reverse punishment, but that\u2019s what we feared. I don\u2019t know if this is real, but it felt like it at the time: every session out of the pool, you lose feel for the water. You\u2019re looking for 0.4 of a second gain on your time: the difference between winning and coming fourth. Every second counts.\u201d\u2018Swimming felt easier than walking\u2019: at the age of five in Kenya. Photograph: Courtesy of Achieng Ajulu-BushellOf all the sessions Ajulu-Bushell vividly describes, one sticks out specifically. \u201cI was 13 or 14 when I was training and my knee, I think, came out of its socket. It hurt like hell.\u201d She dragged herself to the water\u2019s edge in silence. \u201cIn the same way we don\u2019t miss training, the idea of getting an injury was horrifying. I sat on the side of the pool and pushed my knee back into the socket. In hindsight, it\u2019s quite mad.\u201d Pushing to these extremes, she feels, wasn\u2019t unique to her experience.\u201cIt\u2019s more than an open secret,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an expectation. A lot of people I know swam through horrific injuries and eating disorders. We would train until we threw up. Then we\u2019d get back in and carry on. And a lot of the hardcore stuff was, if not celebrated, then made light of. As kids, we found ways to make it normal.\u201d How intended all this is, she suggests, is up for debate. \u201cBut the way you train isn\u2019t just designed to challenge your body. It\u2019s designed to mould your mind. Not just to give you an acceptance of discomfort, but to make you, almost, like it.\u201d This was the mid-2000s. \u201cIt\u2019s not that long ago. And even in the years since, I\u2019m not sure how much elite sport has changed in what it expects from child athletes.\u201dThis pressurised culture wasn\u2019t confined to the pool. \u201cFood cupboards were locked in the kitchen so we couldn\u2019t get at it \u2013 a lot of hyper-vigilance around food, especially as the girls got older. I didn\u2019t start my period until I was 16, because my body fat levels were so low. Half naked on the poolside, a constant interrogation of your body; weighed on scales, tested for fat levels in front of your peers, what you\u2019re eating watched every day. I won\u2019t say it was normal, but it wasn\u2019t specific to where I was training.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionWe\u2019d train till we\u00a0threw up, then get back in and\u00a0carry on. In the\u00a0kitchen, food\u00a0was locked awayShe writes of having her privacy and autonomy stripped through this period of adolescence. In the world of young elite athletes, she says, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bullying. It\u2019s definitely used as a training tactic in some places. Elsewhere, it\u2019s just designed to humiliate. We put our bodies through an awful lot of trauma.\u201d She was 14 when she started weight training. The result? \u201cI\u2019m relatively short, have flat feet, and still wake up in the middle of the night with phantom pains shooting from my hips down to my knees. Listening to coaches screaming at swimmers was normal. At the end of the first chapter, I write about a coach commenting on how our costumes don\u2019t shrink after returning from the summer holidays. For young women that stuff can be very traumatic \u2013 and it happened regularly.\u201dAlongside this intense training regime, Ajulu-Bushell was dealing with another strain: more often than not, she was the only person of colour in these spaces. \u201cMy mum is white. My dad was Black Kenyan. I\u2019d grown up in Africa, with Blackness all around me. It wasn\u2019t, therefore, particularly interrogated.\u201d Then she arrived in Devon. \u201cI write a lot in the book about not understanding or wanting to accept my relationship with Blackness in the very white world around me.\u201dContext here is key. \u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d she says, \u201cthat Black people can\u2019t or don\u2019t swim, but that\u2019s a prevailing mythology. There\u2019s pseudoscience: that our bones are heavier; that we can\u2019t float; that our muscle density is higher. Then there\u2019s generational and cultural trauma in the Black community around swimming and water safety. There\u2019s a history of Black bodies drowning in the Atlantic through the slave trade.\u201d But she was raised across the African continent. \u201cI grew up swimming with Black and brown people in Kenya and South Africa, so that never really rang true to me. And I was also pretty good myself.\u201dAs her rankings climbed, and Olympic promise grew, journalists became interested in this frontier-breaking narrative. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of my Black identity now,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I never felt that at the time. It came with micro-aggressions, comments and ignorance; those small ways children are racist to the person who is different all the time. Nothing I hold against any of them; what was in the press was far more punishable. One article at the time said: \u2018She speaks with a cut-glass British accent.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to be known as the Black swimmer. I wanted to be the best swimmer. Which I was, for a while. In spite of being Black.\u201dNo single event made Ajulu-Bushell hang up her towel. \u201cThere\u2019s no crescendo moment. I just wanted it all to stop. I wanted silence. No more press. Nobody looking at my developing body. I wanted it all to go away.\u201d The 2010 Commonwealth Games hadn\u2019t gone to plan; she\u2019d placed last in her 100m event. \u201cI come back,\u201d she says, \u201cand I\u2019m so tired of all the stakeholders in my success. My body feels like a vessel through which everyone else will realise their dreams.\u201d There\u2019d been talk of her dropping out of school to swim full-time. Academia, like everything beyond swimming, had long taken a back seat: on the eve of her sitting her GCSE exams, reporters had been invited into the school to interview the swimmers. \u201cAnd what if I did drop out of school and mess up my A-levels? Whether or not I made the podium, I decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. I quit.\u201d\u2018We\u2019d do 8 to 10km before breakfast. We were starving all the time\u2019: winning gold as an 11-year-old. Photograph: Courtesy of Achieng Ajulu-BushellSo her future took a different path. Studying fine art at Brasenose College, Oxford. Post-graduation, she spent time in Paris. She made films, worked in comms and started that PhD, before taking on her current job \u2013 chief executive of the 10,000 Interns Foundation, tasked with transforming workplaces for underrepresented talent.One detail, I say, stood out when I read her book. How, despite being part of a wider school community, there was a swimmer-specific boarding house \u2013 on a different site \u2013 where she and the other young athletes lived separately. \u201cIt kept us away,\u201d she says, \u201cfrom the normality of adolescence and teenage-hood. I call it a panopticon \u2013 they were always watching us. When you start to deliberately draw parameters around a group, isolating them from their peers, it\u2019s how you can really start shaping and influencing their lives. How much control can be exerted over their existence. At that age, your schema is yet to fully develop. Put a kid into that system really young and tell them this is what to do, after a few years that\u2019s all they know. Maybe that\u2019s the structure that\u2019s needed. The magic ingredients to make the best elite athletes; blinkers that disincentive you from looking at anything peripheral beyond your lane.\u201d Are the results worth it?She compares it to the ethics of the entertainment industry\u2019s creation of often ill-fated child stars. \u201cThat same lens hasn\u2019t been brought to professional sport,\u201d she believes, \u201cbecause there\u2019s a perceived purity around sport, which stops it blending with that Hollywood conversation. There isn\u2019t money being exchanged in the same way, it\u2019s not seen as work. Kids are amateur athletes. And that\u2019s true, until you take sponsorship. But it\u2019s an investment nonetheless. There are those same stories. Tragic endings for ex-young athletes. Nobody wants to corrupt or pollute the world of sport with these complicated questions.\u201dWith just months before the Paris Olympic Games begins, wider discussions about the human cost of elite sports are once again emerging. Before I even ask the question, Ajulu-Bushell knows what\u2019s coming. \u201cOne of the reasons I didn\u2019t write about all these experiences for so long,\u201d she says, \u201cis because I thought, if I did, I needed an answer to that. It\u2019s like when I was 16 and was asked, constantly: \u2018What do we do to get Black people to swim?\u2019 I was like, \u2018I\u2019m a child, I don\u2019t fucking know.\u2019\u201d\u2018It kept us away from the normality of adolescence and teenage-hood\u2019: at the British Championships in Sheffield, aged 16. Photograph: Courtesy of Achieng Ajulu-Bushell\u201cWe need to keep pushing for reform, and checks and balances, in these spaces,\u201d she says. \u201cAre we going to do away with elite sport? No, it\u2019s too powerful. I don\u2019t want us to. The Olympics is this incredible bastion of resistance and humanity. I don\u2019t think the human race will stop trying to push beyond the boundaries and records set generations before us. But surely we can find safer ways to do it. The media has to answer for the pressure it puts on young athletes. Safeguarding institutions within sport need reform.\u201dThere\u2019d been talk of our photoshoot taking place at the Aquatics Centre in east London\u2019s Olympic Park, home of the 2012 games. Ajulu-Bushell declined; she\u2019s still never been, despite now living in its vicinity. She doesn\u2019t swim today. \u201cNo, never,\u201d she says. \u201cOn holiday, maybe, but I don\u2019t get in the pool. There\u2019s no reason to. Plus, it\u2019s quite antisocial to go to public swimming sessions and swim really, really fast.\u201d\u201cAnd swimming was an addiction,\u201d she says, \u201ca perfect high. When I quit, what I was most scared of was not getting that feeling again. So lots of these bizarre sacrifices, or things that feel sinister. It\u2019s in the context of this prize that was like ecstasy. It\u2019s a tension. It felt heartbreaking to write down so much of what\u2019s in the book.\u201d She looks down at my copy, still conflicted, \u201cbecause even now I\u2019d do it all again for that high, in all honesty.\u201dThese Heavy Black Bones by Rebecca Achieng Ajulu-Bushell is published on 6 June by Canongate at \u00a318.99"}

I had spent years preparing for this moment, and yet when it came, I felt only dread at the thought of freshers\u2019 week and all the social challenges this would inevitably involve.The Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.I had always been something of a shrinking violet and the fact that I now had a close group of friends at school did not helped to assuagemy social anxiety. I assumed this was a stroke of extreme good luck \u2013 a one-off. The potential for rejection seemed immense, and I feared I would spend the next few years in loneliness.I was wrong: I soon made new friends. Yet my shyness lingered as I embarked on my career in journalism \u2013 a bizarre choice, I admit, for someone who felt nervous meeting strangers and loathed the idea of networking. I found ways to deal with those challenges, but it was only within the past few years that I began to truly relish the chance to meet new people.If only I had known then what I know now, my path might have been so much easier. As a science writer, I\u2019ve witnessed a wealth of new research that has identified the psychological barriers that prevent us from building better relationships. Fortunately, my deep dive into the academic literature has also identified practical ways to build social confidence.I\u00a0would turn down party invitations from people I admired, on the assumption they had only asked me out of politeness.Consider a phenomenon known as the liking gap, which describes our tendency to underestimate how much others have enjoyed our company and wish to build a stronger connection with us.In a series of experiments, psychologists asked two strangers to meet and chat and then questioned each party about their expectations and perceptions of the conversation. Before speaking, both assumed that the exchange would feel uncomfortable \u2013 yet they ended up enjoying it far more than they had believed they would. Over countless trials in all kinds of contexts, most people found it far easier to talk to strangers than they had initially feared.If only that pleasure was combined with self-confidence. After a conversation, most people assume they liked the other person more than the other person liked them. Or framed another way: neither party realise quite how appealing they have been and they don\u2019t have faith the other person would be interested in building on that rapport with a future friendship.The liking gap can linger for months. One study asked university roommates to report on their perceptions of each other during their first year of living together. On average, it took each student about nine months for them to overcome their self-doubt and correctly appreciate how much the other person liked them.When I first learned about this research, I couldn\u2019t help but cringe at all the times I had been afflicted by the liking gap. After meeting charming, funny and kind people, whom I wanted to get to know better, I would doubt that this was reciprocated. As a result, I would avoid any further contact for fear that I might seem embarrassingly needy. I would even turn down party invitations from people who I genuinely appreciated and admired, on the assumption they had only asked me out of politeness.Digging into the scientific literature, I soon found examples of many other misplaced fears that stand in the way of deeper and more meaningful relationships. Many of us are too shy about giving compliments or expressing our gratitude for other\u2019s actions, for instance. We assume that they already know how great they are and we doubt our abilities to express those compliments elegantly. We imagine our gestures will seem ham-fisted and gauche.Those worries are largely unjustified. Most people are perfectly capable of distinguishing genuine praise from flattery and we consistently underestimate how much joy our words will bring. Provided that we display sensitivity and common sense, then our genuine appreciation will be welcomed for what it is \u2013 a small act of kindness.Expressing appreciation of others not only brings joy to the person receiving the praise but also to the person saying it; most people feel much better for having spoken their warm feelings. Unfortunately, our natural reserve means that most of us miss out on these opportunities to cement our bonds.We have similarly misplaced intuitions about self-disclosure \u2013 we tend to hold back our intimate thoughts and feelings and instead engage in superficial small talk when people tend to be far more interested in our inner life than we\u2019d expect. This is a shame since that knowledge would be the foundation for a deeper relationship. And when we need help, we believe that people will resent us for our requests, when scientific research shows that they can enhance closeness, by proving our regard for the other person.Whether we regularly feel lonely, fear walking into a party full of strangers, or wish to get along better with our colleagues, most of us could do with a bit more faith in our social skills.Based on my own experiences and the research I have read, I believe this is imperative for anyone who wishes to live well. Feeling socially connected not only brings great joy, it also soothes our stress responses, thereby reducing our risk of many different illnesses \u2013 from the common cold to cardiac arrest. The results from more than 100 studies all show that social connection is as important for our health as diet or exercise. Greater connection can also enhance our creativity. The more nodes we have in our social network, the more exposed we will be to fresh ideas and new sources of inspiration.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionI have found that simply learning about concepts such as the liking gap can help us conquer our shyness, but it also needs perseverance if the effects are to last. As you will have found when learning any skill, greater confidence comes with regular practice outside our usual comfort zones.As my fluency in Italian increased, I was touched to see how my conversation partners saved me from embarrassment For me, an ambition to speak Italian gave me the necessary push. As my fluency in the language increased, I started arranging \u201cconversation exchanges\u201d with native speakers who wished to practise their English. Needless to say, I made many blunders, but I was touched to see how sensitively my conversation partners saved me from embarrassment and how easy it was to build a friendship despite the language barrier. Striking up new conversations in my native language suddenly felt a lot less daunting.You don\u2019t need to go to this extreme. One study took the form of a week-long \u201cscavenger hunt\u201d that encouraged participants to set daily goals to approach and talk to strangers. They could decide to find someone with interesting shoes or eye-catching hair and then chat with them for a few minutes. Day by day, the participants came to recognise the pleasures of being more sociable and were less anxious about the possibility of rejection.We may still need strategies to help offset self-doubt when it kicks in. One tool that I use is \u201cdefocusing\u201d, which involves making a conscious effort to look at the big picture instead of getting hung up on small details. If we think we have made a faux pas, we can remind ourselves of the many other things that we exchanged during the conversation; the other person\u2019s impression of us is unlikely to hinge on a single clumsy comment, which will probably be forgotten. We might also remind ourselves of previous instances in which we\u2019ve instantly jumped to the worst conclusion, but later found our fears were not proven.One of the best things you can do to overcome your shyness is to treat yourself with greater compassion. Many of us believe that self-criticism is essential if we are to behave better in the future, but the scientific literature suggests the very opposite is true. Beating ourselves up over a potential embarrassment only adds to our stress and reduces our capacity to learn from the perceived mistake. A simple exercise is to imagine that you are encouraging a friend or family member who is facing the same challenge or feeling the same worries; you might even write it down in the form as a letter. Once you have expressed those sentiments, you may find it far easier to be kinder to yourself.At the height of my shyness, it would have seemed inconceivable that I would write a book about social connection \u2013 let alone support it with public talks and media interviews. I don\u2019t regret those years of anxiety; when considering the past, my overwhelming emotion is one of gratitude to all the people who proved my fears of rejection to be false. But I do wish that I could go back in time and tell my 18-year-old self about what I had learned. With just a little bit of encouragement and practice, we all have enormous potential to connect.The Laws of Connection: 13 Social Strategies That Will Transform Your Life by David Robson is published by Canongate on 6 June at \u00a318.99.

Carlo Moretti, VeronaSend new questions to nq@theguardian.com.Readers replyAlmost certainly the haircut \u2026 woodworm20Neanderthals have a bad reputation largely due to historical misconceptions and outdated stereotypes. Early depictions painted them as brutish, unintelligent and uncivilised, based on the incomplete and misinterpreted fossil evidence available at the time. This view was reinforced by the need to distinguish modern humans as superior and more advanced.However, recent research has shown that Neanderthals were much more sophisticated than previously thought. They created tools, had a form of language, engaged in symbolic behaviours and even buried their dead. The negative image persists partly because of lingering myths and the human tendency to view anything different or extinct as inferior. graungroansHomo sapiens have far better publicists? Sagarmatha1953I once had a date with a Basque girl and decided I\u2019d impress her by learning a bit about her culture. Unfortunately, I told her that the Euskara language was neanderthal instead of neolithic (come on, it starts with N and has a TH and a L in it). She wasn\u2019t impressed. alexitoPaige Madison has convincingly argued in recent years that the dismissal of Neanderthals as brutes goes back to the discovery at Feldhofer in the Neander valley in Germany in 1856. Based on the size and shape of the skull, leading geologists, naturalists and anatomists concluded that the individual must have been a dim-witted brute. Thomas Henry Huxley (\u201cDarwin\u2019s bulldog\u201d), for example, said that the skull could have held only \u201cthe thoughtless brains of a savage\u201d. PrehistorianPossibly related to the once-dominant school of \u201cWhig history\u201d that sees history as a continuous march of progress and enlightenment imposing its worldview on prehistory. Seen through that lens, Homo sapiens replacing Homo neanderthalensis represents a superior strain of humanity taking its rightful place and a necessary step on the road to human perfection. Seeing Neanderthals as equal to us, but just different, and their replacement as the result of arbitrary factors that made us better suited to the environment than them, is incompatible with the Whig history worldview. So it became convenient to portray them as backwards and primitive, just as it became convenient to portray other human cultures in a similar light through racist stereotyping. ProjectXRayBecause Homo sapiens have an attitude of arrogance towards the rest of the natural world. This is displayed particularly in our wars, in which only the human cost is commented on and the rest of nature ignored. I\u2019m sure that the same arrogance applied to our Neanderthal cousins. Anthony ReedBecause we allegedly conquered them \u2013 or so goes the story that I was taught in the 1950s. We \u201cothered\u201d them. And, of course, together with the spoils, the victors get to write history. Pamela HallThe answer to the question is simple and complex \u2013 it\u2019s due to human nature. People tend to like conformity in the group they are a part of, yet they also like variety in those they marry, because nature pushes for genetic diversity. In short, people tend to be self-contradictory. \u201cMy group is better than your group\u201d has been a steady theme throughout human history.Next, consider beliefs and attitudes back in the 1500s, when the sociological concept of races first started to emerge. People were trying to define the differences between various ethnic groups while also trying to explain the perceived superiority of certain ethnic groups over others. Being dark-skinned at the time (and too often even today) was considered more primitive and therefore less evolved.Fast-forward to Gibraltar in 1848, when the first adult Neanderthal skull was found, but wasn\u2019t recognised as a different species of what we now call archaic humans. (The skull of a Neanderthal child had been found in 1829 in Belgium, but it also wasn\u2019t recognised as a related species.) It was after the discovery of a male \u2013 in the Neander valley of Germany in 1856 \u2013 that scientists figured out the remains weren\u2019t those of anatomically modern humans. The early Neanderthal discoveries were considered bestial sub-humans with just enough cognitive ability to scratch fleas while eating carrion and their own dead.Evolution as we know it today was first proposed, more or less, in the early 1800s (Lamarckism), with Darwin and Wallace\u2019s version being published in 1859. By 1950, evolution was accepted by most biologists.How does all this relate to the bad reputation Neanderthals were subjected to? In simple terms, people often consider \u201colder\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d as more primitive and essentially less evolved or capable. It doesn\u2019t matter if you could drop a person of today into the conditions of 10,000, 50,000, 500,000 or more years ago: most would consider themselves more evolved and better capable of survival than the people who knew what they were doing. Essentially, hubris makes too many people think they are the epitome of life even though we\u2019re all still evolving (hopefully) into the next step of what it means to be human.

I\u2019ve always been the one who cares more, the one who is \u201ctoo intense\u201d and the one who winds up getting hurt. I wear my heart on my sleeve and, as a relatively newly diagnosed autistic woman with ADHD, there are two words that have followed me around and haunted me throughout my entire life: \u201ctoo much\u201d.Until recently, being \u201ctoo much\u201d was a\u00a0source of great shame. I spent my teenage years and early 20s trying to navigate dating and relationships while missing a key piece of information about myself \u2013 that I was an autistic ADHDer. I didn\u2019t know that I was prone to feeling things much more deeply than most people, or that masking made me a chronic people pleaser. I didn\u2019t know that I had a social disability, or that my dopamine-seeking brain might look for stimulation from problematic places (or people). I thought that my too much-ness was just a result of being unlovable, broken or a \u201cbad dater\u201d.It can be helpful to go armed with three conversation topics so you can avoid small talk (if you want to)I often speak about my late diagnosis as a \u201clightbulb moment\u201d \u2013 up until that point, I\u2019d spent my entire life stumbling around in a dark room, walking into walls and knocking things over. Then one day someone turned on the light and allowed me to see what had been going on. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean that the room was tidy or straightforward to deal with once the light was on. There was a huge pile of mess that I\u2019d never known was there that needed to be worked through, but at least I could start the process.This analogy stands strong with dating and relationships in particular \u2013 by no means has my love life become infinitely easier or more straightforward since my diagnosis, but I am at least aware of the challenges I might face, the tendencies I have, and the type of qualities I might want to look for in a person.I sadly cannot give you a handbook on how to have an excellent love life as an autistic person or an ADHDer, but I can share a few pointers which have been helpful for me.Mini golf can make for a great first date. Photograph: Matt Alexander | PA Media.1. Get activeDon\u2019t worry \u2013 I am not about to recommend that you head to an aerobics class for your first date. However, I think \u201cactivity dates\u201d (such as bowling, mini golf, or even a walk in the park) are a great place to start. You don\u2019t have to worry about whether you\u2019re making enough eye contact with your date (you\u2019re either side by side while walking or looking in the direction of the activity you\u2019re doing), and you will always have something to talk about, rather than be left scrambling to make small talk about the weather.As an autistic person, I spend my whole life scripting out imaginary conversations to prepare for every possible scenario \u2013 this can actually be helpful when it comes to avoiding awkward silences on dates. You might find it helpful to go armed with three conversation topics so you can avoid small talk (if you want to) and always have something that you feel comfortable speaking about to fall back on. This is also helpful to bear in mind when writing prompts on dating apps \u2013 answer them in a way that will make people more likely to message you about something you would like to talk about.3. Communicate your needsYou might feel nervous about communicating what you need from somebody, but it\u2019s likely that, if someone hasn\u2019t dated an autistic/ADHD person before, they simply don\u2019t know what it is that you need \u2013 whether that be clearer communication, more space for decompression, or to avoid noisy or busy places. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for it.4. Do YOU like them?As someone who has possibly faced social difficulties, it is likely that your first thought when dating someone is, \u201cdo they like me?\u201d. Rejection sensitivity dysphoria makes us want to avoid rejection at all costs \u2013 even if we don\u2019t like them in the first place. After a first date, check in and ask yourself to list five things you liked about them.5. Deepen your dating poolA big part of masking is mimicking the people around us; for me, this even meant that if all my friends thought someone was hot, I must be attracted to them too. Don\u2019t be afraid to try dating different people than who you\u2019ve traditionally dated, whether that\u2019s looks-wise or even exploring your sexuality. As you unmask and discover the real you, it is likely what you\u2019re looking for in a partner might change too."}

I was 23, new to Australia from Peru, and still shaking off the cobwebs of a conservative Catholic upbringing.To me, Craig looked like someone from another planet: a lean, strong frame, curly beach-blond hair and a smile that seemed to light up the whole city. My English was basic but our shared sense of humour cut through the language barrier.That evening, Craig dropped me home in his hippy van. He told me he worked as a graphic designer but had aspirations to be an artist. Before I got out of the van, he gave me a kiss so tender it felt like a stamp of love.Days later I moved into Craig\u2019s shared rental flat in Tamarama. He had an affinity with nature, and I\u2019d often find him talking to insects as they crawled up his arm. The Pacific Ocean was on our doorstep, and he loved to body-surf way out where the surfers were. He encouraged me to push through my fear of the ocean, teaching me how to read the currents and duck under big waves.Although an introvert himself, Craig didn\u2019t mind me bringing streams of new acquaintances back to our apartment, and together we began to build a soul family.\u2018Together we began to build a soul family\u2019: Craig Ruddy and Roberto Meza Mont at home in Tamarama, Sydney in 2002Around this time, Craig decided to quit his job to pursue art full-time. As Craig worked to establish a name for himself, we subsisted on white bread with Vegemite, cheese and tomatoes.In 2002, Craig had his first solo art show, and in 2004 he won the Archibald prize \u2013 Australia\u2019s most prestigious portrait prize \u2013 for his charcoal drawing of Yol\u014bu actor David Gulpilil. That changed our lives. We were able to buy the apartment next door, and in 2008, as the financial crisis dealt a blow to art sales, we relocated for a time to South America, living in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires. Despite the crisis in South America, people continued to create art, go out, gather and enjoy life.Whatever the brazen pair were doing, there was something sensual, passionate and wondrous about itWhen we returned to Sydney in 2012, our relationship was at a crossroads. Craig was craving a life closer to nature, while I, a city person, wanted to return to Buenos Aires. We discussed the possibility of long distance, but this potential separation weighed heavily on me so I agreed to accompany him on a research trip up to the northern rivers region of New South Wales.One afternoon after we arrived, we left the coast and drove inland, through the Byron hinterland, to look at a property for sale. We got out of the van at a ridge that looked towards mountains. Craig was transfixed by the view. The yard was full of old car parts, bottles and overgrown lantana. The redbrick house was tiny, with low ceilings and walls marred by punches. But Craig was smitten and declared it was the place he wanted to live and die. I could see the challenge it presented through his artist\u2019s eyes, so I decided, cautiously, to trust his vision.Craig Ruddy and Roberto Meza Mont on their property in the Byron hinterland in 2017We moved into a tent beneath an open bay shed on the property. One night, we awoke to find a large rat had chewed through the netting and was feasting inside the bread bag. I was not impressed. I confided in Craig how isolated I felt living there. Ever the optimist, he reassured me: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my love. People will follow.\u201dOne day soon after, I heard Craig yell out from inside the shed. I came running in to find two thick grey and white pythons on an overhead beam, wrapped around each other, moving side to side, writhing powerfully. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting,\u201d I gasped. Craig responded: \u201cThey\u2019re making love!\u201d We laughed. The snakes were so oblivious to us that I forgot to be scared, even when they dropped to the floor and continued tussling. Whatever the brazen pair were doing, there was something sensual, passionate and wondrous about it. As Craig and I stood there together, mesmerised, I realised with absolute certainty I wanted our lives to always be intertwined.\u2018I started to see the beauty in our rural life \u2026 the isolation I had feared melted away\u2019After that, I started to see the beauty in our rural life. We cleared the lantana and replaced it with a vegetable garden. The punch-marked house became our home and a magnet for friends and family. By day Craig painted in the converted shed, and by night we hosted gatherings around our campfire, shared meals in the kitchen and danced. The isolation I had feared melted away.In January 2022, Craig passed away at home from Covid complications. He was 53. The loss still feels insurmountable. But Craig left me with the greatest gift \u2013 a life intertwined with nature and a community who each day helps me navigate the grief. I see him in the technicolor sunsets, in the rustling leaves and in the kookaburras whose easy laughter echoes around the bush. I believe Craig\u2019s spirit remains in the natural world that surrounds me.

So say, if you are overweight, you can say jokes. But if you\u2019re not (you can\u2019t) that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s currently happening. So it\u2019s not really gendered.\u201dReflecting on whether this is a good or bad thing, she said: \u201cI think that\u2019s hard. It\u2019s going into this territory of like saying, \u2018Well, only straight actors can play straight roles, and gay actors can play gay roles,\u2019 which I think is total nonsense.\u201cI think you should be able to play any role that you want. But I always think, in comedy, your job is to always flirt with that line of what\u2019s acceptable.

My grandparents, who are in their 90s, just so chilled and cool with it.\u201cRamona\u2019s family, not as much. Her mum has luckily come around now, her father still doesn\u2019t talk to her, but we\u2019re hoping that will change.\u201dWilson said she had been in the process of using a surrogate to have a child when she met Agruma \u2013 having to tell her just three months into their relationship.\u201cI\u2019d already been planning to use a surrogate to have a child and I\u2019d done several rounds of IVF and I had one embryo transfer, which sadly didn\u2019t work,\u201d Wilson said.\u201cAlmost right at meeting Ramona, I was planning on the second embryo transfer and I was like, \u2018Babe I don\u2019t know how to tell you this, but I\u2019m going to have a child kind of around November.\u2019\u201dShe added: \u201cRamona just looked at me and said, \u2018Well, I love you and if you have a child, I\u2019m going to love your child exactly the same way.\u2019\u201dThe TV presenter and actor added that she hoped her daughter Royce, born in November 2022, had her work ethic and always feels loved.The full interview with Wilson will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 10am and will also be available on BBC Sounds."}

The shame that is creeping in may be about pressure to conform", "author": "Philippa Perry", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jun/02/i-dont-want-to-invite-my-alcoholic-dad-to-my-wedding", "text": "The question I\u2019m a 30-year-old man who works in mental health. I\u2019m due to get married in a few months\u2019 time. I don\u2019t want to invite my father. He and I have been estranged for several years. We have each other\u2019s mobile numbers, but we don\u2019t use them. My father has a lifelong alcohol-use disorder (AUD). He was a violent man. When I was 11, my mother managed to divorce him. Since then, we have mostly parted ways, but his side of the family still attempts to guilt-trip me into caring for him.I have grown up, gone to college and am now enjoying my career. I have come to understand more about addiction. I don\u2019t feel resentment towards him and tend to see this in a matter-of-fact way. I do not have any affection for this man, who happens to be my father. I have come to see him as any other person with AUD, but one who happens to have fathered me for a short period of time. (I don\u2019t have fond memories of the time we shared in the same household.)But as we get closer to the wedding day, I fear the absence of the father of the groom will be noticeable and commented upon, given that the bride will have both her parents there. I feel no love or attachment to him. My partner and her family say they\u2019ll support me whatever decision I come to. Can you help me feel a bit more reassured, or less afraid about not inviting him?Philippa\u2019s answer What is it about weddings that makes us believe we must follow so many protocols and rules? You wouldn\u2019t hesitate not to ask your father to any other event. What is the cultural norm we are trying squeeze into here? Is shame involved? Rationally, you know that having an irresponsible, violent, drunk father is not your fault and yet I wonder if you have feelings that it\u2019s somehow shameful not to invite him. Are you imagining people disapproving of you for not having him there? Not inviting him is the lesser of two evils, but it seems it is still something of an evil. I think in your shoes I might feel the same way, but why? You know what you want to do, but self-doubt is creeping in. I wondered whether to say to you that you must invite him. Because then you might be likely to rise up in opposition and be more determined to say no. But paradoxical interventions are risky and I really would not like for you to have your father at the wedding when you don\u2019t want him there.When faced with the concept of a wedding, people have expectations. You are probably being bombarded with cultural norms and \u201cshoulds\u201d from friends, family and even Instagram, and I expect you are feeling some pressure to conform. You, like me, are a mental-health professional so you may know from experience that it can be easier to spot someone else\u2019s issues than our own. A difficult childhood may mean that, as children, we had a little voice in our heads saying something along the lines of: \u201cIf only I was good, Dad would stop shouting.\u201d Children tell themselves things like this and take responsibility for their treatment, because were they to believe themselves powerless (as they are) it would be too frightening. Too frightening to believe that someone out of control was in charge of them, or that they had zero power to make their dad love them and stop being drunk. Feeling responsible gives them the hope that if only they could get it right, the horribleness would stop.There may be a little kid in you still trying to \u2018do the right thing\u2019I\u2019m imagining something like that may be in your subconscious mind and you are again confronted with the possibility of getting it right or getting it wrong for other people, or even him. Rationally you know it\u2019s not your fault he has alcohol-use disorder, but I wonder if the little kid in you wants to do what he might think is the right thing. You say your father is just like any other addict to you, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s how you want to think of him rather than how you really feel about him deep down. There may be the ghost of the kid in you thinking, \u201cIf only I could get it right.\u201dWe want to be \u201cgood\u201d and get things \u201cright\u201d for the friends and family we do care about, because we want to be accepted, we want to belong and we want to be loved. You may not be being pressured into inviting him, but you may have been pressured about the meal, the ceremony and the flowers \u2013 so this wedding may be becoming something that has to be \u201cright\u201d, and then who to invite becomes part of this rightness.Trust your instincts and stay true to yourself and do not invite him. Inviting unreformed alcoholics to weddings is often a terrible idea no matter how closely related to the bride or groom they are, and neither do you want anyone there to whom you feel (mostly) indifferent. Yes, people may comment on his absence; it\u2019s no reflection on you if they do. It\u2019s absolutely OK not to follow every cultural norm of the wedding ritual.For help with these issues, go to Adfam (adfam.org.uk); Al-Anon (al-anonuk.org.uk) or DrugFAM (drugfam.co.uk)Every week Philippa Perry addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

Overnight, thanks to Keir Starmer\u2019s plan, it was understood that British\u00a0private schools, far from\u00a0being an ever more exclusive service for the most affluent, are dear to countless immiserated parents whom the Mail, highlighting\u00a0their plight, goes so far\u00a0as to call \u201cpoor\u201d. Some of them are so hard up, journalists report, they live in modest houses, drive \u201cold bangers\u201d and, when they don\u2019t \u201csacrifice\u201d meals out, deny themselves West End shows. The forgoing of one possible purchase for the sake of another is invariably known, in the lexicon of pro-private school coverage, as a sacrifice.It follows, somehow, that the public should do whatever it takes to protect this formerly obscure minority of a minority: unfortunate private school parents who have survived Liz Truss and the cost of living crisis, only to face the brutal prospect of state education. The alternative being, it is predicted, so many refugees that state schools will be overrun, unable to cope, and\u00a0Starmer\u2019s scheme will be fiscally counterproductive.Or maybe it won\u2019t. In the past, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies says in its assessment of the scheme, private school parents have tended to absorb fee increases.All this has been exhaustively explored, but the impact of the election announcement in the rightwing press, if nowhere else, has been to intensify the existing passion around what might appear\u00a0a\u00a0relatively niche political\u00a0issue, perhaps even a moderate-looking compromise. There were once\u00a0hopes that Starmer would remove\u00a0private schools\u2019 charitable status, not just their tax\u00a0breaks.United in outrage, undeterred by a poll suggesting majority support for Labour\u2019s proposal, his critics have, careless of looking obsessive, been amplifying their coverage, running more sob stories, more predictions of catastrophe, more reproaches from pained headteachers and warnings of closures: anything to make readers care about parents who may soon not be able to afford what they, themselves, never could, and take against a policy that leaves the private school system intact. Whatever Starmer does to private school enrolment, it will do nothing to protect the country from another Boris Johnson. It does not help VAT opponents that the impact of identifiable victims is apt to be undermined, as it rarely is in the aftermath of, say, earthquakes, by the very details intended to move us to compassion.One of the Mail\u2019s innumerable reports might have been stronger last week had it omitted the potentially \u201cdevastating effect\u201d (reduced access to a theatre) for a 12-year-old, presumably the most affecting victim it could find, \u201cwho has already appeared in a touring production of Les Miserables and a Nintendo Switch advert\u201d. Her parents, we learned, \u201calready sacrifice holidays and meals out\u201d.In the Sunday Times, we met parents forced to \u201cshop at Aldi, the German discount supermarket, and drive a 19-year-old Peugeot and a 10-year-old Hyundai\u201d. As reluctant as one is to wish anyone a greater misfortune, you\u2019d think they could have found a gaunt fee-payer outside\u00a0the more resonant Lidl, pushing home her pitiful shop in an\u00a0old pram.To add to compassion fatigue, the media\u2019s anti-VAT hobbyists might want to note the evidence, in below-the-line comments, polls and elsewhere, that even their subscribers could pick more substantial hills to die on. Especially, as some point out, when the sector\u2019s most recognisable products, outside acting, are Sunak, Cameron, Farage and Johnson.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionCritics have been amplifying their coverage, running more sob stories, more predictions of catastropheTrue, it\u2019s the best Labour tax-horror story going, but consider the most recommended comment under the Sunday Times piece \u201cPrivate school bill for two children could hit \u00a31.2m under Labour\u201d (that is, \u00a31m without Labour): \u201cThe Times\u2019s obsession with this issue is getting out of hand.\u201d And the second: \u201cI feel sorry those parents don\u2019t have more intelligent children who could survive in a meritocracy.\u201dIt was a Sunday Times journalist, after all, who discovered that a parent at St Paul\u2019s, one of the most expensive schools in the country, had rebuked another member of a WhatsApp group, the Tory MP Greg Hands, for sharing anti-VAT material. \u201cCan we stop assuming everyone is a Tory in this group.\u201d And even Tories might conclude, as a Spectator columnist did last week, that private schools would be better placed to protest \u201chad they not spent the past 30 years steadily pricing the middle classes out of private education\u201d.If the bizarre campaigning on behalf of private schools does not illustrate, given its remoteness from majority preoccupations, the still disproportionate influence of the privately educated and their educators, it is otherwise mystifying.Why, in a cost of living crisis afflicting all but the wealthiest, are Tory sympathisers advertising the enormous sums they consider, minus the addition of VAT, to be reasonable? The average private school fee is \u00a317,500 a year.Why, given the existence of subscribers who endorse private education but oppose its tax advantages, do editors insult these readers, in column after column, for\u00a0engaging in the \u201cpolitics of envy\u201d? Some, effectively, are accused\u00a0of envying themselves. Reserving for others the implication that, if\u00a0they were \u201chardworking\u201d and\u00a0ate frugally,\u00a0they too could find\u00a0the \u00a317,500.Non-users of private schools are\u00a0repeatedly reminded to revisit\u00a0that sometimes overlooked question: what the existence of these charitable institutions does for\u00a0others.It makes no sense. But I do hope they keep it up. Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist"}

It\u2019s simply about wanting to make a fairer society | Will Hutton | The Guardian", "caption": "Labour\u2019s leadership needn\u2019t struggle to define the ideology; it\u2019s in its very constitution", "author": "Will Hutton", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/02/socialism-isnt-a-dirty-word-its-simply-about-wanting-to-make-a-fairer-society", "text": "Socialism is what\u00a0a\u00a0Labour government does, pronounced Herbert Morrison, one of the titans of the Clement Attlee administration in the 1940s. It wasn\u2019t a very good answer then to the perennial doctrinal disputes about what constitutes socialism that have haunted the party since its foundation in 1900 \u2013 and it works no better in 2024.So what is this socialism that Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves, Wes Streeting, Darren Jones and Jonathan Reynolds were all asked about last week, whose tenets they purport to follow even as the party wrangled over the \u201cpurge\u201d of its left? Convincing, on-the-front-foot answers proved elusive.Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, had the trickiest time. He wasn\u2019t so much a socialist, he explained on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, but a Christian socialist \u2013 as if faith resolved the dilemma of whether his socialism reconciles the classical definition (state and social ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange being the chief means to common good outcomes) with today\u2019s Labour policy programme. Was his socialism the same doctrine as Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s? Discomfited, he declared his was a socialism that \u201cput people first\u201d, promoted growth by working with business and so built a better society. But as presenter Emma Barnett reframed it, that amounted to little more than \u201ccapitalist-flavoured socialism\u201d. The division could hardly be clearer or harder to bridge.To the same question, Reeves declared herself a social democrat, rooting her philosophy in liberal William Beveridge\u2019s mission of creating a cradle-to-grave welfare state. Streeting was a \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d, which he defined as being part of the European social democratic mainstream \u2013 but social democracy, like socialism, is in difficulty across Europe because it can\u2019t define itself attractively. Starmer described himself as a socialist and a \u201cprogressive\u201d, which meant putting country before party. But any one-nation Tory would say the same. For his part, Jones said he rejected labels and simply replied he was proud to be \u201cLabour\u201d and a \u201ctrade unionist\u201d.All of the answers were serviceable, but all essentially defensive. The difficulty is that socialism is a loaded term representing a doctrine in crisis, which, beyond a small band of socialist faithful, too many find both menacing and unappealing. Menacing because socialism closes down individual freedoms and aspirations. Unappealing because state monopolies are inefficient, snuffing out the growth, innovation and embrace of the new that comes with capitalism. Leftwing leaders have to square a seemingly impossible circle \u2013 assuring party activists they are socialist, but defining it in a way that means they won\u2019t threaten freedom, suppress business or unleash inefficient state monopolies. But there are good answers available, not least because capitalism, left to itself, leads to vast inequality, chronic underinvestment, monopoly, instability and exploitation. It needs superintendence and active management, which can only come from the left questing for common good outcomes. Labour must find and sustain good answers, crucial both as a compass for good government and as a foundational anchor around which the party can coalesce unambiguously as a party of the centre-left \u2013 vital to quell further descents into factionalism.Fellowship \u2013 having each others\u2019 backs, sharing wealth \u2013 is at once understandable, and an idea to which everyone can relateStart with Attlee\u2019s answer in 1954, which not only turned the provocation back on the questioner, but retained the moral cutting edge that makes socialism \u2013 or more accurately the ethic of socialism \u2013 compellingly attractive if expressed correctly. A devotee of William Morris, Attlee inspiringly invoked Morris\u2019s view that socialists \u201cbelieve in the kind of society where there is fellowship for all. You can\u2019t get that in a totalitarian society, you can\u2019t get that while there\u2019s great inequalities of wealth. That is the hope of the world.\u201dFellowship \u2013 having each other\u2019s back, working together better to secure common goals, sharing wealth fairly, believing in the \u201cwe\u201d, recognising the vital importance of the social, cleaving to democracy \u2013 is at once understandable, non-abstract and an idea to which everyone can relate. It is fellowship (as I argue in my new book, This Time No Mistakes: How to Remake Britain) that imbues the ethic of socialism with its force \u2013 and which does not need to translate into rampant statism.That was well understood by Tony Blair who, in the run-up to the 1997 general election, went one step further. He declared an ethic of socialism \u2013 of fellowship \u2013 was the enduring foundational Labour value. But to complete the picture, this ethic also furthered a bounded individualism, creating the conditions in which individuals best flourish and better themselves, while accepting their responsibilities and obligations to society; all as enduring and as important aims as fellowship. In this sense, an ethic of socialism and progressive liberalism, accepting we have individual aspirations, were interdependent: one stood behind the case for a floor below which no one could fall; the other to offer scope for individual endeavour and responsibility, but bounded by social obligations so it did not collapse into avarice and extreme selfishness. The \u201cfloor\u201d coexists with the \u201cladder\u201d. Blair then rewrote clause IV in Labour\u2019s constitution to express precisely this fusion and to which every Labour party member \u2013 ranging from its new ex-Tory adherents to Diane Abbott \u2013 is\u00a0perforce a signatory.This reassertion of the \u201cwe\u201d as a crucial part of the moral universe has two crucial follow-ons. It leads directly to pro-investment, pro-green economic policies dynamised by public investment, and justifies the refashioning of the savings and financial system to serve all our ends, along with active public efforts to make housing, education, health and a solid income floor the foundation of a good society. Agile public agencies superintend partnership with business \u2013 boosting what works and closing down what does not.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe second follow-on is the moral dimension. The urge to collaborate, to share and to be fair is foundational\u00a0to the human experience. Anyone who does not want to partake of the common life and society, as Aristotle insisted, is \u201ceither a beast or a god\u201d. As contemporary society, increasingly atomised, imposes solitude and loneliness on ever more people who no longer have the consolation of faith, to assert the \u201cwe\u201d is to offer a lifeline. In the US, what to do about the epidemic of loneliness is becoming a hot political issue. It will be the same here.So 21st-century progressivism is about binding the \u201cwe\u201d and the \u201cI\u201d and on that fusion to act purposefully to create a capitalism that works for the common good and a society that works for all. Government will organise itself around the achievement of great missions to deliver those ends. This is the philosophy, purpose and policy of Starmer\u2019s remade Labour party, which could embrace all wings of the party. It would serve it well to say so more clearly \u2013 now and for the future."}
{"title": "Now they think they\u2019ve lost, the Tories are full of big ideas | David Mitchell | The Guardian", "caption": "National service? Abolishing university places? This absurd flurry of announcements is to make it seem, once Sunak has gone, that they did everything they could", "author": "David Mitchell", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/02/tories-rishi-sunak-national-service-david-mitchell", "text": "The Tories are full of ideas at the moment. They\u2019ve announced three major new policies in the past week. It feels like someone asked Rishi Sunak, \u201cWhat would you do if you were prime minister?\u201d, and he got really into answering. Then he must have remembered that, weirdly, he is prime minister. And the accurate answer would be: \u201cNot much other than pander to the right-wing of my party by attempting to deport refugees to Rwanda and wait for an economic miracle while being relentlessly photographed in a hard hat.\u201dBut what a productive burst of enthusiasm! Suddenly the Conservatives are announcing plans to bring back national service for 18-year-olds, introduce a \u201ctriple lock plus\u201d to protect pensioners from income tax and abolish more than 100,000 university places. Is all this an attempt to stick it to the young for being overwhelmingly likely to vote Labour (if they vote at all)? Was it a response to Keir Starmer\u2019s proposed extension of the franchise to 16- and 17-year-olds, which would certainly enhance the leftwing vote?What can the Tories do to counterbalance such a youthful lefty influx? Extend the franchise to people who have died? Why should people\u2019s political opinions perish with them? Do the views of the dead not count? We should be urgently re-enfranchising corpses. What a scandal that \u201cthe few\u201d, having saved the country during the Battle of Britain, no longer have a say in who runs it.The received wisdom is that people get more rightwing as they get older and, with rising life expectancy because of advances in medical science, that\u2019s good news for the right. It\u2019s old people not young ones who are the future, and the triple lock plus is Sunak\u2019s attempt to shore up support from that demographic. Though it raises the question of how many tens of thousands more crotchety old rightwingers might still be on the electoral roll if the Tories hadn\u2019t screwed the NHS quite so hard over the past 14 years. Maybe they were worried those people were tipping over into supporting Reform: a future Tory government would keep people alive long enough to become rightwing but allow them to die before they get too rightwing.The phrase \u2018you\u2019ve had your chance\u2019 comes to mind whenever they propose anythingBut why these new Tory proposals? Maybe it\u2019s natural: manifesto launches are coming up, so it\u2019s an obvious time for announcing policies. Labour, sitting on a massive opinion poll lead, is playing it very safe on that front. Rachel Reeves doesn\u2019t seem to be planning to do anything at all other than move house. Perhaps this creates an opportunity for the Conservatives to knock Labour out of the running with a bewildering bombardment of ideas. Is that the plan?Possibly. But there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the Tories have been in office for 14 years, and Sunak himself for more than 18 months. The phrase \u201cyou\u2019ve had your chance\u201d comes deafeningly to mind whenever they propose anything. When Reeves said she wouldn\u2019t increase income tax or national insurance, the economic secretary to the Treasury, Bim Afolami, had the breathtaking nerve to say: \u201cJust the same old Labour party who have no plan to cut taxes\u2026\u201d What?! He\u2019s criticising Labour for not planning to change a status quo for which, as a minister in the current government, he is responsible. They should cut taxes even though he hasn\u2019t. Of course, he\u2019s also saying the Tories will, or would. But they haven\u2019t, have they? If they think Labour should, why haven\u2019t they? (To be fair, Liz Truss tried but it broke the economy.)It\u2019s the same with all these new policies. They just make us think: \u201cIf you reckon this is such a good idea, why haven\u2019t you done it already?\u201d The Tories can\u2019t get away with announcing what they would do if they won the election because they\u2019ve already won the past four elections and we know perfectly well what they would do because it\u2019s what they did. Their only path to victory is to persuade voters that what they did was OK, even good \u2013 or at least better than what their opponents would have done.This is an enormously difficult task given the horrendous state of the country. And Sunak\u2019s team must have concluded that it\u2019s actively impossible \u2013 indeed that, whatever they do, electoral defeat is inevitable. For me, that is the only logical inference from this absurd flurry of policy announcements: the people around the prime minister are certain that he and the Conservatives will lose the election. If we assume that, their behaviour suddenly makes sense. Their priority is not really maximising Conservative votes, but rather making it seem in retrospect, after Sunak has been defeated, that they did everything they could.Despite everything, Sunak\u2019s best bet would still probably be trying to sell the government on its own record, viewed through the lens of the Conservatives\u2019 dated self-image as a party of fiscal prudence, economic competence and legislative probity (notwithstanding the Johnson and Truss administrations). That is, the whole \u201cthe plan is working\u201d approach they favoured until the moment the election was called. Not everyone is broke or disillusioned and millions always vote Tory. But it would still probably fail and, if and when it did, his campaign team would look like they hadn\u2019t risen to the challenge.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionTo create that impression they need to be able to point to the efforts they made and these big ideas are evident efforts. \u201cWe were coming across as a dynamic new government in waiting,\u201d they can say, \u201cbut the situation was irredeemable from the start.\u201d It is with this future defence in mind that they have, ironically, abandoned the most effective strategy in order to appear to have adopted a more effective strategy.

Two years ago, a coroner\u2019s verdict that the death of Molly Russell was contributed to by \u201cthe negative effects of online content\u201d, including algorithmically delivered self-harm material, was a watershed moment. Now Ellen Roome, whose son Jools Sweeney took his own life for unknown reasons in Cheltenham in 2022, has become the latest campaigner for changes to the law in this area.Her petition calling for parents whose children have died to have a right of access to social media accounts has attracted 120,000 signatures and is likely to be debated by MPs early in the next parliament. While the online safety bill, which received royal assent in October, significantly strengthened a weak and outdated regulatory framework, Ms Roome and the other families in the Bereaved Parents for Online Safety group are right that more needs to be done.Big efforts have already gone towards ensuring that parents are not left in the dark in situations where young people have taken their own lives, and there is believed to be a connection to online interactions or material. A new power for coroners to access children\u2019s data was agreed when the online safety bill was debated. But rather than being incorporated in that bill, it was added to data protection legislation instead. That bill fell when Rishi Sunak called the general election. The amendment and the work that went into it were lost.It now seems likely that it will fall to a Labour government to take this broken pledge to parents forward. Given the anguish of their losses, they should not be kept waiting longer than necessary. Campaigners including Ian Russell, who chairs the Molly Russell Foundation \u2013 which aims to prevent suicides by young people \u2013 and Esther Ghey, the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey, have shown extraordinary courage.So far, the tech companies have proved uncooperative and resistant to pressure. Michelle Donelan, then culture secretary, said the Molly Russell inquest had demonstrated a \u201chorrific failure of social media platforms to put the welfare of children first\u201d. Experts believe many people would be astonished to learn that, even in cases where a young, vulnerable teenager has tragically died, parents have no automatic right to access their accounts, or to find out what material they have been viewing. Concerns that the tech platforms take reputation management more seriously than children\u2019s safety are added to by decisions such as the one Meta took last month, to rescind a job offer to a cyber-intelligence analyst immediately after he criticised Instagram\u2019s safeguarding failures.In recent weeks MPs have indicated their willingness to consider a smartphone ban for under-16s. The Molly Rose Foundation and specialists including Lady Kidron believe proactive regulation and enforcement, not prohibition, is the road to take. But there is wide agreement that, as it stands, more web protections are needed. Rules barring under-13s from social media platforms must be made to work by Ofcom. Businesses must be publicly accountable for their design decisions, and compelled to engage with bereaved parents in a humane way. Last year\u2019s online safety act was just the beginning."}

If lodged in the lungs, asbestos fibres can cause the deadly cancer mesothelioma many years later. There is a national ban on asbestos.The NSW premier, Chris Minns, responded by saying that the state\u2019s Environment Protection Authority (EPA) was throwing everything at tracing the source of the mulch. When the EPA found that mulch had been spread across Sydney into schools and parks, media managers and some reporters set about reassuring the public that the asbestos fragments were mostly \u201cbonded\u201d ones which are not as dangerous as fibres. So far there have been no prosecutions.What the NSW government knew but hid from the public was that the EPA is managing an even more urgent regulatory failure in which some of Australia\u2019s biggest waste companies had been distributing material known to contain asbestos fibres and contaminants including microplastics, lead and other contaminants.The material, known as \u201crecovered fines\u201d is produced from residue of construction and demolition waste to be recycled in construction and road projects, and in public spaces such as sporting fields. It\u2019s also sold as cheap fill by landscape and garden companies.In February, Guardian Australia brought this even more serious dimension of the scandal to the public when it revealed that the EPA had conducted extensive studies in 2013 and 2019, which demonstrated that waste facilities producing recovered fines were failing to comply with regulations intended to limit the spread of contaminants.In response to these alarming revelations, the environment minister, Penny Sharpe, acknowledged that there had been \u201ca regulatory failure\u201d. But three months later, she herself has become part of that regulatory failure.Recovered fines are big business, with about 700,000 tonnes produced a year. And while much of the contaminated material may be more safely buried under roads, some of it is in parks, schools, gardens, playgrounds and childcare centres. No one knows exactly where it has gone because despite shocking results, no one has been tracking it. Asbestos near children is a particular worry as they are more likely to play in the dirt and also more likely to inhale fibres.How asbestos-contaminated mulch sparked the NSW EPA's biggest investigation - videoThe EPA knew that its compliance system had failed. Some staff argued for reform to restrict its uses and toughen the testing regime. It moved cautiously with a huge amount of industry consultation. In 2022, it finally announced that it would revoke the old system and impose a new one. The waste industry hit back, accusing it of taking the sector by surprise and jeopardising jobs.In a classic case of regulatory capture, the EPA reversed its decision, meaning that the old compliance is substantially unchanged today.In March, Sharpe responded to the crisis by introducing tougher penalties for contaminated waste offences. While welcome, this solution sidesteps other glaring problems around non-compliance. Prosecutions are rare and EPA staff are instructed to use them as a last resort. Companies are rarely given maximum fines even for extended breaches, and even a $4m fine can be absorbed by big culprits.The NSW Greens\u2019 environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, who was previously CEO of the Environmental Defenders Office, has argued that the minister could issue a direction that harmful substances in consumer products be considered a priority issue and prevented from entering the environment or make regulatory changes.Guardian Australia revealed this week that the facilities found in the 2019 investigation not to be meeting EPA sampling rules included some of the Australia\u2019s biggest waste companies including Bingo Industries and Benedict Industries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While no laboratories have been accused of wrongdoing, some laboratories and independent experts think that there needs to be reform to stop potential manipulation of results.In the absence of government action, Guardian Australia bought four products at Sydney landscape supply shops and had samples analysed by accredited private laboratories. It found that two did not comply with state regulations on pH levels and one was found to contain asbestos fibres. One of the products that passed the laboratory tests contained large physical contaminants including glass and a metal screw.You would expect that these developments would inject a public sense of urgency into the situation, but there is no evidence of that.An EPA spokesperson said the regulator is concerned but \u201cwould require more information\u201d.Minister Sharpe has said she will wait for a chief scientist\u2019s report, which is not due until the end of the year, before considering any \u201cnecessary changes\u201d. The chief scientist investigations are secret and will also be subject to industry pressure. It does not investigate poor conduct or compliance.If not for a former EPA compliance officer, a Greens MLC and Guardian Australia\u2019s environment team, the rest of us would still be in the dark about \u201crecovered fines\u201d. How much more needs to be exposed before the NSW government gets the political will to act? We want a circular economy but to be sustainable, it should not expose the public to unacceptable health risks. A parent would be worried if their child picked up a lump of asbestos in the park, but they would be much more anxious if they discovered that they had been playing in mulch containing asbestos fibres or another contaminants for years."}

I\u2019d bet that for most of us this horrible thought experiment conjures up a Jimmy Savile-style monster sitting in front of the computer screen. But new research from the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, a child sexual abuse prevention charity, highlights how this paradigm does not by itself account for the scale of online offending. Cling to it too hard\u00a0and it could hamper our ability\u00a0to prevent the abuse of\u00a0children.Because child sexual abuse is such a horrific and unthinkable crime, we tend to \u201cother\u201d the men who do it. They won\u2019t be men in our families, workplaces and communities, but evil individuals in other people\u2019s lives. This is comforting for us adults, but the complacency it engenders puts children at risk. It turns child sexual abuse into something that happens to other people\u2019s children, not those you love, and if it were happening, of course you\u2019d know because you would be able to spot it.The figures tell something different: child sexual abuse is depressingly common, with at least 15% of girls and 5% of boys experiencing it before the age of\u00a016, and abuse within the family is one of the more common types reported\u00a0to police. The sad truth is that many of us will unwittingly know men who have sexually abused children.Another misperception is that child sexual abuse is driven primarily by the perverted sexual attraction some men feel towards pre-pubescent children. That accounts for some offending, but it is far from the whole story: child sexual abuse, like other sex crimes, can be more about risk, power and control; and it is also very much a crime of opportunity. If there is more opportunity to offend, more child sexual abuse will happen.There is perhaps no place that offers greater opportunities to engage with child sexual abuse than the internet, whether through viewing images of child sexual abuse, or creating them by grooming and exploiting children online. This type of offending is growing: in 2022, the police arrested 850 people a month for online sexual offending. These figures are the tip of the iceberg. The National Crime Agency estimates that up to 850,000 people pose a sexual threat to children online and offline.The Lucy Faithfull Foundation (which receives charitable funding from the Indigo Trust, of which I am a trustee) runs various interventions, including a helpline, for men who have offended or who are at risk of offending, as part of its work to prevent child sexual abuse. It published a paper last week, based on its clinical work, that highlights that most people accessing the helpline reported problematic use of legal pornographyViewing pornography does not mean someone will necessarily escalate to illegal sexual images but,\u00a0for the men the\u00a0foundation worked with, \u201cadult pornography\u00a0often serves as a gateway to viewing sexual images of\u00a0children\u201d.The theory about how one leads to the other is thought to be because some people become desensitised in their response to pornographic stimulus. Porn has never been more easily available: it is the subject of one in four internet searches, and the four largest pornography sites received a combined 11bn visits a month in 2020.Porn platforms make more profit the more they keep individuals engaged. Exploitation and abuse of women is rife in the industry \u2013 both in the production side and also in the way it depicts sex. There is a vast amount of violent and coercive content that features women reacting positively or neutrally towards aggression.Some people report needing to consume increasingly novel \u2013 and in some cases, extreme \u2013 forms of pornography in order to get the same \u201chit\u201d as from when they first started watching porn. The online world makes that entirely possible. So some men who have ended up viewing sexual images of children may not have originally been sexually attracted to children, according to the Lucy Faithfull Foundation.Another charity, the Centre of Expertise on Child Sexual Abuse, highlights that the most striking feature of men who view but do not produce sexual images of children is their \u201cordinariness\u201d compared with those convicted of contact child sexual abuse.This makes for uncomfortable reading because it challenges our preconceptions about the men who view child sexual abuse online.But it is so important in understanding how to prevent online abuse. There is more to be done by relentlessly targeting and taking down illegal online content, but also intervening and disrupting men at risk of veering towards viewing child sexual abuse imagery could help stop the appalling abuse of children involved in production and sharing of this content. The Lucy Faithfull Foundation piloted a chatbot on PornHub that popped up if someone tried to search for\u00a0unlawful content involving children. It directed them to support\u00a0services to stop their behaviour and during the 18\u00a0months it was in operation the number of searches\u00a0fell.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionRightly, there has been a broader debate about the impacts of porn in light of evidence suggesting that exposure to violent pornography is associated with attitudes supporting violence towards women in men, and that early exposure to pornography is linked to harmful sexual behaviours in children and young people, including sexual abuse perpetrated by young people towards their\u00a0peers.There is still a huge amount we don\u2019t know but, as with other potentially harmful behaviour, it is likely to be riskier for some individuals than others.The emerging evidence that, for some men, an unhealthy relationship with pornography may be the first step to engaging with online imagery of child sexual abuse\u00a0is a reminder that the conversation about porn cannot stop at how to safeguard children and young people, as critical as that is. We also need a better understanding of the long-term harm pornography can have on adults, and how they might be able to protect themselves. Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist"}

In May 2004, when\u00a0he was a 12-year-old kid with floppy blond hair and a lifetime before him, he placed Real Madrid\u2019s white shirt into the foundations of their training ground, a new home for an institution that, the legend carved into that granite slab said, \u201crespects its past, learns from its present and believes in its future\u201d. On the first day of June 2024, now a 32-year-old man with a greying beard and a history behind him, he was in Madrid colours at Wembley, leaping to head in the goal that helped secure their greatest work of all.Twenty years had passed almost to the day, and it was done. How much longer before anyone witnesses this again, if they do? That day Carvajal, an infantil in the academy, stood alongside a 77-year-old Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, the most significant player whom club football has had, a symbol of their everything; the man whose arrival in 1953 changed Madrid and the game for ever, forging their legend, an identity. Now, when it comes to the European Cup, the competition in which they did it and feel as their own, Carvajal stands above him. Even saying it sounds absurd, a glimpse of what has just happened.No one has won this competition more times. A tiny, select group have won it as many. Five men have lifted the European Cup six times and three of them are Carvajal\u2019s teammates: on Saturday he, Luka Modric, Nacho Fern\u00e1ndez and Toni Kroos joined Paco Gento, whose seemingly impossible feat has taken 58 years, and one prodigious decade, to match. Carvajal is the only one of this generation to have started all six finals, although he was forced off early in two, his tears there adding poignancy to the goal that pulled them through here.\u201cI came as a kid and now I\u2019m here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is going to be very hard for this [record] to be taken away from us.\u201dThere were many images, words and moments to hold on to at the end of Real Madrid\u2019s 15th \u2013 fifteenth \u2013 European Cup. Kroos leaving like that. Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior scoring another Champions League final goal, at 23: \u201cBallon d\u2019Or, no doubt,\u201d Carlo Ancelotti, the Madrid manager, said. Jude Bellingham, winning the trophy for the first time, aged 20, who said he was holding it together until he saw his mum\u2019s and dad\u2019s faces. Ancelotti intervening again, with calm clarity. \u201cHe knows what he is doing,\u201d Bellingham had said. There was the way they did it, which is their way, a story seen before. They had been let off alive, Ancelotti admitted, but they had done it.Jude Bellingham sits with his brother, Jobe, as their parents Mark and Denise talk in the background after the Champions League final. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The ObserverYou didn\u2019t seriously think they wouldn\u2019t, did you? They have not lost a final in the competition since 1981: played nine, won nine. \u201cIt seems that in these games, we\u2019re not able to lose,\u201d Kroos said. \u201cTo be level with Gento is crazy, something I never thought I am going to achieve.\u201dThrough all those images, those little vignettes, there was that basic fact, the thing it all built to, that expresses the enormity of this: Real Madrid had just won their 15th European Cup. Now they will ask for the 16th, Ancelotti was told, to which he started laughing. When he eventually stopped, he replied: \u201cIt is like that.\u201d As if to prove the point, the president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, then said exactly that and this week he will announce Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s arrival. But it is a stock phrase. That\u2019s tomorrow and this is now, and always. Forget the next one, at least for a while. Stop. Take it in. Don\u2019t look forward, look back.Because this is about emulating the eternal, surpassing it even, less perhaps about the 15th than about it being Madrid\u2019s sixth in 10 years: from Lisbon to London, 2014 to 2024. No one has ever done this, except them. Four of this team have won as many European Cups as Liverpool, never mind Gento, the\u00a0only Madrid player who won their first five European Cups, from 1956-60, and their sixth in 1966.The \u201966 team, known as the Madrid of the Ye-Ye, a transliteration of the chorus from the Beatles\u2019 She Loves You, stood apart, an outlier. Madrid had been knocked out for the first time in 1960 \u2013 by Barcelona \u2013 and lost the finals in 1962 and 1964. Di St\u00e9fano had gone and economically they were not in good health. The team that beat Partizan in the 1966 final was made up entirely of Spaniards.Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano (right), scores Real Madrid\u2019s first goal in 7-3 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1960 European Cup final at Hampden Park. Photograph: APIf that contributes to this current side perhaps not being seen as emulating Madrid\u2019s golden generation, embodied by winning the first five European Cups rather than six in the opening decade, there are other elements too. That team built Madrid\u2019s identity and comes with an aura of invincibility, of dominance, an imperious march to the title, that this generation may not match. Instead there is the implausibility of these successes: the miracles, the fortune, the goalkeepers suddenly losing their minds, the plain silliness of some of their wins. Even they agreed 2022 was pretty ridiculous. When they were defeated 4-0 by Manchester City the following year in the semi-final second leg, some saw it as\u00a0justice and the end.\u201cThere\u2019s always a \u2018but\u2019,\u201d Ancelotti has said. Rodrygo admitted recently that Manchester City were \u201cbetter\u201d than them. In this final, again they were made to suffer. The run from 2014 began in the season in which Atl\u00e9tico Madrid were domestic champions, and in the final it took a 93rd\u2011minute equaliser and an extra-time barrage to beat them. In\u00a0two of the three they won in a row between 2016 and 2018, Barcelona were La Liga champions and that, Madrid\u2019s then coach Zinedine Zidane admitted, was the most objective test, the title he most valued.And yet as Kroos presciently said after that elimination in Manchester: \u201cIt is not normal to win the Champions League all the time. The last time I heard it was the end of an era was 2019, so we\u2019re OK.\u201d He was right, they were OK; better than that, better than anyone. No buts, this is inescapable: six European Cups in a decade, an achievement to match any, even that one, untouchable in black and white. Sometimes you need to step back from the history you\u2019re making to see that you\u2019re making it. Time changes perceptions, of this era and that one; the past is seen differently and one day this will be the past and it will be glorious.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ferenc Puskas once recalled that Barcelona\u2019s Hungarians would wind him up because they seemed to be able to \u201cdo us whenever they wanted\u201d. During the first five years that Madrid won the European Cup, they were Spanish champions twice; Athletic and Barcelona won the league three times between them. When they won the sixth, Atl\u00e9tico won the league. Five teams \u2013 Athletic, Barcelona, Atl\u00e9tico, Deportivo, Valencia \u2013 have been champions of Spain when Madrid have been champions of Europe.But so what? Six in a decade, for goodness\u2019 sake. And, actually, this Madrid have a better league record than the golden generation. Madrid: European champions. It\u2019s started to look obvious, feel inevitable, when it is not. After 1966, Madrid went 32 years without lifting the trophy that makes them. They won it again in 2000 and 2002, although from the seventh to the ninth, those were different looking teams and different eras, only Roberto Carlos, Ra\u00fal and Fernando Morientes starting all three finals, with Zidane scoring that iconic volley at the end of his debut season.Zinedine Zidane, who won the European Cup as a player and manager with Real Madrid, places the trophy for the presentation at Wembley. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The ObserverThe gal\u00e1cticos had come, glory assured. But they got stuck. The 10th tortured them; the d\u00e9cima became an obsession and it resisted them for more than a decade. Six years in a row, they didn\u2019t manage to win a knockout game. Twelve years they waited, which felt like an eternity, and eventually reached the final in 2014. With the clock on 92.48 they were losing, and to Atl\u00e9tico of all teams: that Sergio Ramos header is surely the single most sliding-doors moment in their history. \u201cEvery morning when he comes in, I feel like kissing him,\u201d Paul Clement, Ancelotti\u2019s assistant, said. The most traumatic of ends awaited them, everything about to be ripped up.Instead, it was the beginning. Madrid had the 10th. Two years later they had the 11th, then the 12th and the 13th in a row, which was extraordinary enough. That cycle appeared to be closing. Players went \u2013 Cristiano Ronaldo, Ramos, Gareth Bale, Casemiro, Rapha\u00ebl Varane \u2013 and so did the coaches. Ancelotti had been sacked within a year and then Zidane \u2013 who had begun as his assistant and was now the competition\u2019s most successful manager \u2013 departed.Madrid were struggling to find a replacement. One day Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez, the director general, received a call from Ancelotti about the possibility of Everton taking Madrid players on loan. At one point the Italian asked him how the search was going. Not good, he was told. To which Ancelotti joked, well, there is one obvious candidate, the best coach in the world.Within a day it was done; within three years, Madrid lifted the decimocuarta and the decimoquinta, the best decade the biggest club of all have had, opening and closing with the competition\u2019s most successful manager on the bench and four of its five most successful players on the pitch. The kid who had laid the first stone 20 years earlier provided the final touch, their work complete."}

I was watching an old Blondie show video without the sound on recently and I realized that Debbie comes off as part little kid doing a pretend show in front of a mirror and part erudite, glamorous, risky woman. Top of the Pops was Dreaming this time; it had gotten to No 2. I don\u2019t remember if the BBC had given up on the fake-recording-to-placate-the-union- gods thing by then.Debbie Harry and Chris Stein in New York, 1978. Photograph: Roberta Bayley/RedfernsBehind everything was this lingering drug situation. Cocaine was everywhere all the time. We would meet some big celebrity and he would pull a bag of blow out of his pocket. But a lot of people were doing heroin as well. People we knew were functioning addicts. We began seeing a guy named Al who turned us on to the art of chasing dragons. A simple form that still requires a little technique \u2013 it\u2019s just inhaling the smoke of the dope while it is burned on tinfoil. We had screwed around with sniffing heroin already, but smoking it was pretty insidious. One night a neighbor of ours got mugged in Central Park. He fought off his attacker but got banged up and came over to our apartment. He was all bruised, so we chased some dragons with him without mentioning what it was. I think he thought it was some form of weed. He definitely left feeling better. That was the problem; it made you feel better.At one point in one of the eternal Blondie tours, everyone was about to travel from Switzerland to Paris. Somebody in Zurich had given Debbie and me a bunch of heroin. As we were boarding the plane, after Debbie, Clem, and I went through the metal detector, one of the crew guys right behind us had a metal container of hashish in his shirt pocket that set off the alarm and he got nabbed. Everyone in the band and crew from the culprit back was taken away. Two security guys came on the plane and told us they\u2019d be removing our luggage to investigate and asked if we wanted to leave the flight and accompany our bags as they were searched. Clem left; Debbie and me said no, thanks, and stayed on the flight. We did have this fairly large quantity of drugs with us and we became concerned lest we get busted arriving in Paris. We dumped most of the dope in the plane toilet but put a small amount in a cuff of Debbie\u2019s pants. Of course nobody even looked at us when we landed, and we spent the afternoon stoned, wandering around the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es while everyone else sat around in an office at the Zurich airport in their underwear."}

But spirituality is not the same as being happy. Spirituality, according to almost of the world\u2019s great wisdom traditions, requires work, service and sacrifice.The world\u2019s dominant religions \u2013 Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam \u2013 all encourage practices such as yoga, mindfulness meditation, chanting, prayer, group singing and dancing. These have long been effective tools in giving followers an experience of deep connection, sometimes accompanied by sensations of awe, ecstasy and transcendence \u2013 feelings that encourage them to return.But a sense of joy or connectedness is not an end in itself. These feelings are the emotional motivators of ethical action. Every religion sets out rules for right conduct \u2013 consider Buddhism\u2019s eight-fold path, Judaism\u2019s 10 commandments, or Vedic Hinduism\u2019s restraints and observances. Indigenous traditions go beyond these religions, including humans and non-humans (or \u201cmore-than-humans\u201d, as the Potawatomi botanist and writer Robin Wall Kimmerer describes our partners in the natural world) in the circle of those to whom we owe service.Yet today\u2019s global wellness industry would have us think that spirituality is just another dimension of feeling good. The Buddhist practitioner Miles Neale coined the term \u201cMcMindfulness\u201d to describe the western tendency to extract practices from ancient religious traditions and turn them into \u201ccolourfully packaged bite-size morsels for \u2026 mass consumption\u201d. The US$1.5tn wellness market seeks to sell the health benefits of spirituality, divorced from the ethical frameworks within which these practices developed.Religious ethical frameworks are hugely damaging when they are used to support power inequities in the realms of gender, class, race and sexual identity. But the use of spiritual practices, in the absence of any ethical requirements, can also be damaging. For example, scientific studies have shown that yoga and meditation can actually increase people\u2019s sense of \u201cspiritual superiority\u201d and focus on the self rather than quieting the ego and encouraging charitable acts of service.Evangelical Christian megachurches have grown, well, \u201cmega\u201d through their use of age-old practices such as group singing, music and pageantry. They create experiences of \u201ccollective effervescence\u201d, as identified by the sociologist Emile Durkheim back in 1912 as the foundation of religion. An age-old problem arises when churches connect such spiritual emotions not to ethical action but to intolerance, selfishness or greed.As far back as the 14th century, Christianity was taking advantage of people\u2019s spiritual feelings for money-making ends, selling \u201cindulgences\u201d for the benefit of souls in purgatory (God\u2019s hypothetical waiting room). Martin Luther opposed this practice as detracting from people\u2019s ability to give to the poor. In one of religious history\u2019s great ironies, Luther\u2019s theology of a personal connection to God would eventually provide the foundation for the prosperity gospel of some of today\u2019s megachurches.Living a spiritual life is not about adhering rigidly to a church dogma. Nor is it about engaging in practices such as meditation in the absence of a larger context. Indeed, yoga means \u201cyoke\u201d and the type of yoga popular in the west is just one way unite oneself with a greater consciousness, something bigger than oneself. Other yogas of the Hindu tradition include work, philosophy, learning and acts of service.I don\u2019t want to be \u201cMcMindful\u201d. I don\u2019t want to extract practices from religious traditions to commoditise them and make myself feel good about myself. Well, I probably do want to feel good about myself. But wellbeing practices start and end there, whereas spiritual practices are supposed to extend myself beyond my \u201cself\u201d, encouraging me to contribute to the wellness of all beings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Five Great ReadsEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

If I am going to spend 20 minutes a day sitting on my butt cultivating compassion to others, I am also going to get up and act on that sensation, making donations, volunteering or just being nice to someone I don\u2019t really like. If I am going to sing about how God/dess loves us all every Sunday, I am also going to take that love and turn it into charitable, non-judgmental acts of kindness every other day of the week.I can meditate and do yoga (actually I kind of suck at yoga) or raise my hands in group worship. But I cannot treat these activities and the feelings they create as ends in themselves. These practices are tools to help me stay focused, cultivating the attitudes and emotions that sustain me as I attempt to live an ethical life.

But Richard Linklater\u2019s latest film has a pronounced point of difference: divorced college professor Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) only pretends to be a hitman, luring prospective \u201ccustomers\u201d into committing conspiracy to murder while cops wait outside. The plot swings into gear when Gary talks Madison (Adria Arjona) out of arranging to kill her abusive husband, then falls in love with her.The film has been billed as a \u201csomewhat true story,\u201d inspired by a 2001 feature published in Texas Monthly magazine.

Photograph: \u00a9 Mattel, Inc.It wouldn\u2019t be accurate to say that Greta Gerwig\u2019s spectacularly successful Barbie movie brought the toyline back into the zeitgeist, because it never left. But there\u2019s a renewed interest in Mattel\u2019s very famous doll, which Lagueria Davis\u2019 new documentary explores from an interesting perspective. It focuses on the Black Barbie doll, first released in 1981 \u2013 more than two decades after the original, very white Barbie premiered.The film reportedly draws on the famous \u201cdoll test\u201d from the 1940s, which found that children of colour assigned positive characteristics to white dolls and negative characteristics to the Black ones. Variety\u2019s Lisa Kennedy described the film as a \u201cjam- packed\u201d and \u201cwryly playful\u201d investigation.Honourable mentions: Hitler and the Nazis: Evil on Trial (TV, 5 June), Sweet Tooth season 3 (TV, 6 June), Bridgerton: Season 3 Part 2 (TV, 13 June), Parasite (film, 15 June), Taken (film, 15 June), Trigger Warning (film, 21 June).StanPriscillaFilm, US, 2023 \u2013 out 1 JuneIn news that\u2019ll surprise no one who is familiar with either director, Sofia Coppola\u2019s film about Priscilla Presley is very different to Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Elvis biopic, released the previous year. It\u2019s an elegant adaptation of Priscilla Presley\u2019s 1985 memoir, with a very captivating Cailee Spaeny playing the eponymous character, who meets Elvis (Jacob Elordi) at a party when she\u2019s just 14 and he was 24.Unfolds as it does from its subject\u2019s perspective, the film leaves judgments around Elvis potentially being a groomer to the viewer: suffice to say, it certainly doesn\u2019t present him in a flattering light. There\u2019s a swelling sense of emptiness in this stylistically beautiful film; an aching feeling that the protagonist\u2019s spirits are slowly being drained.Hotel CocaineTV, Canada, 2024 \u2013 out 17 JuneChris Brancato, co-creator of Narcos, carves up some more marching powder for his new show revolving around Miami\u2019s Mutiny Hotel, described by the official press materials as \u201cCasablanca on cocaine\u201d. Danny Pino plays its general manager, Roman Compte, who explains in the trailer that the hotel was \u201cneutral territory, where drug dealers avoided killing each other because everybody was having too much fun\u201d.

The film weaves in commentary from colleagues including Baz Luhrmann, Gillian Armstrong and Cate Blanchett.

This show reimagines the tale of Lady Jane Grey (played by Emily Bader), who was queen of England for just nine days before she was deposed and executed the following year.The trailer takes a flippantly revisionist tone, raising a middle finger to history, the official synopsis declaring that \u201cwe\u2019re retelling history the way it should have happened: the damsel in distress saves herself\u201d.Honourable mentions: Hannibal seasons 1-3 (TV, 1 June), Jerry Maguire (film, 1 June), Rolling Thunder (film, 1 June), Stand by Me (film 1, June), Taking of Pelham One Two Three (film, 1 June), Looking for Alibrandi (film, 4 June), The Boys season 4 (TV, 13 June), Promising Young Woman (film, 18 June), Anyone But You (film, 21 June), I Am: C\u00e9line Dion (film, 25 June).BingeHouse of the Dragon season 2TV, US, 2024 \u2013 out 17 JuneDragons, dragons, dragons! A Game of Thrones spin-off centered around those flying pyromaniacs practically sold itself. And yet the first season didn\u2019t have enough dragons, in my opinion, and also felt paralysed by its own grandeur, afraid or unwilling to take risks.There\u2019s no doubt however that the arrival of the second season is a cultural event. Showrunner Ryan Condal has indicated he will address the dragon deficient, announcing that five new ones will flap their wings in season two. The story continues to revolve around the Targaryen dynasty and a civil war that takes place approximately 200 years before the events of GoT.FantasmasTV, US, 2024 \u2013 out 8 JuneI\u2019ve watched the first episode of this surreal Emma Stone-produced comedy series created, written and directed by Julio Torres, and can assure you there\u2019s nothing else out this month remotely like it. Based in a bizarro alternate world, lit up with overripe neon colours, a very loose storyline follows Torres\u2019 orange-haired protagonist as he searches for a lost earring in New York City.The narrative trajectory seems to be inspired by the rhythms of dreams, taking long chunky detours and side steps, including a bizarre parody of an Alf-like TV show, with Paul Dano playing a man who gets frisky with a fluffy puppet-like alien creature. It\u2019s strange in very self-conscious ways, with notes of David Lynch and Michel Gondry.Honourable mentions: The Craft (film, 1 June), Ren Faire (TV, 3 June), Am I OK?

But his celebrity-shedding performance in the Safdie brothers\u2019 gritty streetside drama might be his best.Taking place over 24 hours, the film follows bank-robbing brothers Connie (Pattinson) and Nick (Ben Safdie) in a high octane plot involving stolen money and LSD. There\u2019s bust-ins, break-outs and on-the-run action, executed with Scorsesean verisimilitude. Pattinson\u2019s wild performance has the explosive charge of a young Al Pacino or Robert De Niro.Film, US, 1997 \u2013 out 1 JuneRobert Zemeckis\u2019 classic sci-fi ponders the relationship between science and science fiction, significant breakthroughs often synonymous with great imagination and longing. Jodie Foster\u2019s stargazing scientist fulfils a lifelong ambition when she discovers an encoded message from aliens, which she discovers is a series of instructions (slightly more elaborate than your average Ikea ensemble) on how to build a transportation machine. The more the story progresses, the more it engrosses \u2013 all the way to a very tripping ending.Dark AgeFilm, Australia, 1987 \u2013 out 7 JuneArch Nicholson\u2019s creature feature about a group hunting for a 25-foot crocodile begins iconically: the late and great David Gulpilil in an Akubra hat, on horseback herding cattle. From that moment there\u2019s an energy to this film that really sings. The aforementioned croc has the respect of local Aboriginal people, and also John Jarratt\u2019s wildlife ranger, who\u2019s assisted in his expedition by Gulpilil\u2019s Adjaral and Burnam Burnam\u2019s Oonadabund.

The plotlines converge when the self-centered and scheming Julian cottons on to the idea that uniting with his son might help rehabilitate his image.The jokes are often laugh-out-loud funny and the performances very entertaining \u2013 Theo lovable and charming, Miller perfect as a babbling Brit with an amazing ability to drown in his own words. I flew through all eight episodes.Ladies in BlackTV, Australia, 2024 \u2013 out 16 JunePeriod dramas are catnip to ABC viewers, and who doesn\u2019t enjoy watching people wearing beautiful clothes? Ladies in Black follows on from Bruce Beresford\u2019s 2018 film of the same name, which was based on Madeleine St John\u2019s 1993 novel The Women in Black, revolving around employees of the ladieswear section of a Sydney department store circa 1959. The TV show moves into the 1960s, as they \u2013 according to the official synopsis \u2013 \u201cface tumultuous lives navigating societal shifts and personal challenges\u201d. The cast includes Debi Mazar, Miranda Otto, Jessica De Gouw and Kate Box.Honourable mentions: Not Going Out (TV, 3 June), Speechless (TV, 3 June), ER (TV, 3 June), ABBA: Against The Odds (film, 9 June), Bluey Minisodes (TV, 16 June).Disney+The Bear season 3TV, US, 2024 \u2013 out 27 JuneCarmy, the head chef! Sydney, the chef de cuisine! Marcus, who makes those beautiful pastries! There\u2019s lots of excellent characters in The Bear. The second season of this well-loved and critically acclaimed drama changed its key location from a humble sandwich shop to a fine dining restaurant, that process creating much commotion and consternation. The show can be terribly stressful one moment, heart-rending or heartwarming the next. So far there\u2019s been no indication that the quality will drop, so bring on season three.Honourable mentions: Clipped (TV, 4 June), The Acolyte (TV, 5 June), Becoming Karl Lagerfeld (TV, 7 June), Under the Bridge (TV, 12 June), Diane von Furstenberg: Woman in Charge (TV, 25 June).Apple TV+Bread and RosesFilm, 2023, Afghanistan/US \u2013 out 21 JuneA still from the documentary Bread and Roses.

The latest begins with Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s lawyer Rusty Sabich giving the jury a spiel about how his job is to prove reasonable doubt; soon he\u2019ll be the accused. Well, soon-ish: the first episode of Presumed Innocent (all I\u2019ve watched so far) only just gets around to implicating him in the murder of his colleague and lover Carolyn (Renate Reinsve). The series was executive produced by JJ Abrams, adapting Scott Turow\u2019s 1987 of the same name.Honourable mentions: Land of Women (TV, 26 June), Fancy Dance (film, 28 June), WondLa (TV, 28 June)."}

The results were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the world\u2019s largest cancer conference.The study was led by University College London, University College London hospital, the Christie NHS Foundation Trust in Manchester, St James\u2019s University hospital in Leeds, University hospital Southampton and the University of Glasgow.Prof Mark Saunders, a consultant clinical oncologist at the Christie, said the trial results were \u201creally very exciting\u201d.\u201cImmunotherapy prior to surgery could well become a \u2018gamechanger\u2019 for these patients with this type of cancer. Not only is the outcome better, but it saves patients from having more conventional chemotherapy, which often has more side-effects. In the future, immunotherapy may even replace the need for surgery.\u201dBowel cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. There are more than 1.9m new cases and more than 900,000 deaths a year, according to the World Health Organization.In the trial, funded by Merck Sharp and Dohme and sponsored by University College London, researchers recruited 32 patients with stage two or three bowel cancer and a certain genetic profile (MMR deficient/MSI-High bowel cancer) from five hospitals in the UK.About 15% of patients with stage two or three bowel cancer have this particular genetic makeup.Patients were given nine weeks of pembrolizumab, also known as Keytruda, before surgery instead of the usual treatment of chemotherapy and surgery, then monitored over time.Results show 59% of patients had no signs of cancer after treatment with pembrolizumab, with any cancer in the remaining 41% of patients removed during surgery.All of the patients in the trial were cancer-free after treatment. When standard chemotherapy was given to patients with this genetic profile, fewer than 5% had no signs of cancer after surgery, UCL said.Over the next few years, the trial will also assess overall survival and relapse rates.The approach also meant patients did not require any post-operative chemotherapy, which has side effects and is tough to endure.Dr Kai-Keen Shiu, the trial\u2019s chief investigator and a consultant medical oncologist at UCLH, said: \u201cOur results indicate that pembrolizumab is a safe and highly effective treatment to improve outcomes in patients with high-risk bowel cancers, increasing the chances of curing the disease at an early stage.\u201dShiu cautioned that the team would need to wait to see whether the patients in the trial remained cancer-free over a longer period of time, but said the initial indications were \u201cextremely positive\u201d.\u201cImmunotherapy can make tumours disappear before surgery. If you melt the cancer away before surgery you normally triple survival chances,\u201d Shiu added. \u201cIf patients have a complete response to pembrolizumab it can triple your chance of survival.\u201cPatients also don\u2019t need any chemotherapy after so they avoid all those side effects.\u201dDr Marnix Jansen, a clinician scientist at the UCL Cancer Institute, said more work needed to be done to assess pembrolizumab before it could be considered standard treatment. \u201cBut given the quality of the outcomes in this trial I think it\u2019s possible that we could see it in the clinic within a couple of years if subsequent trials are similarly successful.\u201d"}

The former cattle station, about 1,000km west of Brisbane, is home to 26 species that are found no where else in the world \u2013 including the red-finned blue-eye.The springs, desert safe-havens of artesian water, are protected by foot-high fences made of shade cloth which keep the gambusia out and native fish populations in.At least, that was the idea. But then a rehabilitating water table saw Edgbaston\u2019s springs more than doubled in size over the last few years, which in turn caused about a quarter of the fences to be breached by the invasive pest.Dr Rossini collecting DNA samples. Photograph: Calumn Hockey/Bush Heritage AustraliaThe culprit behind the burgeoning springs is a government bore capping scheme causing the Great Artesian Basin aquifers to re-emerge. Or, in other words: it was successful environmental management.\u201cIt\u2019s a poison chalice,\u201d Gilligan says. \u201cThe extra spring flow increases the size of springs that native fish and other spring fauna and flora can occupy, but it makes managing the threat much more difficult.\u201d Three years of flooding due to above average rainfall hasn\u2019t helped either, he adds.With water now seeping beyond the shade cloth fence lines, opportunistic crabs and yabbies have enough real estate to burrow under them.

The 4cm-long invaders were introduced to Australia from the US in 1929 in an effort to control mosquitoes and have since been declared a noxious pest. \u201cThey\u2019re bullies\u201d says Dr Renee Rossini, a Bush Heritage freshwater and wetlands ecologist. Without intervention, within 12 to 18 months of a breach the red-finned blue-eye will disappear.To save the compromised populations, ecologists catch and translocate surviving native fish to heated holding tanks back at camp, poison the gambusia with a few sprinkles of off-brand vegetable derris dust (a garden pesticide), reinforce the fence line, drain the spring, wait for it to refill and finally, reintroduce the native species.For a small spring that can take a few weeks. For larger interconnected pools of artesian water, it can take a year or longer.\u2018It got very, very dire\u2019: Dr Gilligan measuring fish at Edgbaston reserve.

That affords it the same protections as a national park and will ban petroleum and mineral resource extraction on the reserve in perpetuity.It\u2019s the second property in the state to receive the status after legislation was introduced in 2020 to better protect private land of exceptional natural and cultural value.Queensland environment minister, Leanne Linard, says it\u2019s the only state in Australia to provide such a high level of protection to private property.The agreement will \u201censure this estate will remain a site of international environmental significance well into the future,\u201d Linard says.\u2018Plants, animals and country have all come together here to create something really, really special,\u2019 Dr Rossini says.

The tool provides farmers with long-term climate projections out to 2070.Farmers such as Mayne can plug in their farm\u2019s location and the commodity they produce, and receive information that can help them better understand the impact of global heating on their livelihood.A study analysing the usefulness of the tool to farmers was published in the Nature Climate Change journal this month. It measured how 24 Australian farmers perceived the risk of global heating on their operation before and after using the software.Whether the projections are of use to farmers or \u201care they only the dream of scientists\u201d was the central question in the mind of lead author Dr Yuwan Malakar.\u201cPeople talk about climate change being a distant phenomenon,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s something happening in the future, we don\u2019t need to act on it, they say.\u201dBy localising climate projections, the study found, farmers were able to better understand future climate risks, potentially reducing their \u201cphysiological distance\u201d from global heating, Malakar said.One farmer surveyed was planning on expanding his avocado operations but, after using the software, Malakar said, he decided to consider changing his crop altogether. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it,\u201d he said.Another farmer from Tasmanian was fearful of cold snaps damaging their crop but said the software\u2019s projection of fewer and less intense frosts in the region as the planet warms had eased that concern.The financial implications of a changing climate are already being felt. A 2019 report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences found the annual profit of Australian farms had decreased by 22% on average in the past two decades due to global heating.The program was funded by the Future Drought Fund. This month the government announced an additional $519m for the fund and said it would be restructured to better reflect global heating\u2019s threat to Australian agriculture.Peter Holding, an outreach officer for Farmers for Climate Action who runs a mixed sheep and cropping farm outside Young, New South Wales, said farmers were aware becoming of the challenges caused by a warming climate.\u201cMany farmers are recognising climate change, they are concerned about the extremes that are happening \u2026 more intense storms, more floods, more fires,\u201d he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

High unemployment, power cuts, violent crime and crumbling infrastructure have contributed to a haemorrhaging of support for the former liberation movement.The pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA) won 87 seats, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) - a new party led by President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s bitter rival, the former president Jacob Zuma \u2013 took 58, and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a Marxist-Leninist party led by the ousted ANC youth leader Julius Malema, took 39.Chart showing vote share by partyThe ANC also lost its majority in three provinces: Northern Cape; Gauteng, which is home to the commercial centre Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria; and KwaZulu-Natal, where MK was the largest party.\u201cWhat this election has made plain is that the people of South Africa expect their leaders to work together to meet their needs,\u201d Ramaphosa told an audience of politicians, diplomats and civil society leaders after the official results announcement, as thunder rumbled outside.\u201cThey expect the parties for which they have voted to find common ground, to overcome their differences, to act and work together for the good of everyone.\u201dRamaphosa also joked, to laughter from the crowd, that he wished it was true when the electoral commission chairman accidentally said that he was announcing the 2029 election results.The president faces questions about his future, though, as the ANC turns to the task of coalition building. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Zuma\u2019s MK party said they had boycotted the election results event.Zuma had warned before the results announcement that it should not go ahead, saying \u201cpeople would be provoked\u201d, raising the spectre of the deadly riots that broke out when he was sent to prison in 2021.The position of Ramaphosa was not on the table during the coalition talks that will now take place, the general secretary of the ANC said before the final results were announced.ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula told a press conference at the election results centre: \u201cIf you come to us with a demand that Ramaphosa must step down as the president, that is not going to happen \u2026 It\u2019s a no-go area. You come to us with that demand, forget it.\u201dMK leaders have said they will not work with the ANC while it is led by Ramaphosa, who Zuma is hell-bent on exacting revenge against. Zuma was president from 2009 to 2018 and was forced to resign by the ANC amid corruption allegations, which he denies.Jacob Zuma said the final results announcement should not go ahead as \u2018people would be provoked\u2019. Photograph: Alet Pretorius/Reuters\u201cPolitical parties have approached us and we will be talking to \u2026 everybody,\u201d Mbalula said. \u201cTalks about talks are in full swing.\u201cWe\u2019ve got many reservations about that party, but we will talk to them,\u201d he said of the MK. \u201cBut no political party will dictate terms like that to us as the ANC.\u201dThe ANC is in its weakest position since it swept to power under Nelson Mandela in 1994. Nonetheless, it has options beyond Zuma\u2019s MK.Chart showing ANC\u2019s declining vote share since 2004A tie-up with the DA could be favoured by the more business-friendly wing of the ANC. However, such a coalition would face criticisms from the many black South Africans who see the white-led DA as favouring the interests of white people, which the DA denies. Some analysts have said that bringing in a third, black-led party could help the ANC head off those criticisms.DA leaders have said a coalition is an option, as well as a \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d arrangement with an ANC minority government and staying in opposition.Another option for the ANC, and one that is likely to be preferred by the left wing of the party, is to link up with the EFF.A coalition with Julius Malema\u2019s Economic Freedom Fighters is likely to be preferred by the left wing of the ANC. Photograph: Phill Magakoe/AFP/Getty ImagesThat option would need another partner to clear the 50% needed, however. Often mentioned is the Inkatha Freedom party (IFP), which took 17 seats, and, like the MK, gets most of its support from Zulu people.The MK had demanded a recount, making unsubstantiated allegations of vote rigging.\u201cNobody must declare tomorrow. If that happens, people will be provoked, we know what we are talking about,\u201d Zuma, 82, told reporters at the results centre on Saturday. \u201cDon\u2019t start trouble when there is no trouble.\u201dThe words of Zuma, who was the ANC\u2019s intelligence chief during apartheid, had raised fears of violence. More than 300 people were killed in riots in July 2021 riots after Zuma was sent to jail for contempt of court.The constitution stipulates that parliament must sit within 14 days of the final election results and elect a president at that first sitting."}

NGA director Nick Mitzevich refused to reveal the identities of any of the complainants.On Sunday, Rinehart\u2019s company, Hancock Prospecting, issued a statement \u2013 its first since the portrait controversy began \u2013 denying Rinehart had initially approached the National Portrait Gallery offering a portrait of herself for its collection. Instead, it was the gallery that first approached her, the statement claimed.\u201cThe National Portrait Gallery approached Mrs Rinehart asking if she would sit for a portrait, in or around 2017, perhaps 2018,\u201d the statement said.Gina Rinehart gave portrait of herself to National Portrait Gallery, Senate estimates hears \u2013 video\u201cThe National Gallery then advised that they wanted this to be done by one of their chosen artists. Mrs Rinehart preferred that a West Australian artist provide the portrait, this being at no cost to the [portrait gallery] and therefore no cost to the taxpayer.\u201dAs reported in the Guardian on Friday, these discussions took place several years before the current controversy erupted.\u201cIt has been falsely stated or implied in the media, potentially from the way this was discussed in Senate estimates, that the portrait was recently provided to the [portrait gallery],\u201d the Hancock Prospecting statement said, alluding to the inferences made in some media reports that the Rinehart-approved portrait was provided to the National Portrait Gallery in response to the NGA\u2019s portrait.\u201cThis is not correct. The portrait was gifted to the [portrait gallery] by Mrs Alix Korte in 2019.\u201dKorte is a Perth-based realist artist and the wife of Hancock Prospecting\u2019s chief executive, Garry Korte.The Hancock Prospecting statement said that Rinehart paid no money to Korte for a series of portraits the artist did prior to 2019. While the billionaire does not know which portrait the artist eventually donated to the National Portrait Gallery, she does recall that all the Korte portraits \u201cwere very carefully done and captured in detail her appearance at that time\u201d.On Friday, the director of the gallery, Bree Pickering, told Senate estimates a portrait of Rinehart had been gifted to the board, but did not say when.\u201cThe gift came from her,\u201d Pickering told the hearing, referring to Rinehart.\u201cHowever, as we\u2019ve processed the deed of gift related to that, there were some conditions that came along with that gift that meant those conditions are currently under negotiation.\u201dPickering added: \u201cWe don\u2019t often accept gifts with conditions \u2026 we will work with an artist, often, to understand how they would like their artwork displayed. But the sitter does not normally have any say over how the work is hung.\u201dOn Sunday, the gallery confirmed the initial approach had been made by the gallery to Rinehart, but stood by its assertion that the donation of the portrait had come from Rinehart, not the artist.Neither Rinehart\u2019s spokespeople nor the National Portrait Gallery have responded to the Guardian\u2019s questions over why it has taken five years to negotiate the terms under which the Korte portrait can be admitted into the gallery\u2019s collection.\u201cThe transfer of legal title of an outright gift into the National Portrait Gallery of Australia Collection is conditional on the acceptance of the terms of a Deed of Gift,\u201d a statement from the gallery said on Sunday.\u201cThe negotiations of the terms of the donation are ongoing with Hancock Prospecting who own the deed of gift and the copyright license of the work. As the negotiations are ongoing, we cannot disclose them at this time.\u201d"}

The clue is in the use of numbers and letters.In listing \u201cprimary considerations\u201d for the home affairs department and the AAT to weigh up in making these decisions, the executive government intended them to be ranked in descending order.The department (and presumably the AAT) didn\u2019t automatically do that because that\u2019s not what its written direction expressly says.This is about the wording in ministerial direction 99, the guide used by the minister\u2019s departmental delegates in the first instance to decide if there are good reasons to overturn a convicted criminal\u2019s visa cancellation. Where the delegates decide the cancellation should proceed, the same direction is then used by members of the AAT who adjudicate on appeals to those decisions.Section 501 of the Migration Act triggers the cancellation process when a visa holder is convicted of an offence punishable by 12 months or more in jail.But the law also provides some wriggle room, in the form of a ministerial direction setting out issues to be considered in deciding if the person should indeed be deported or can stay.Albanese announces reversal of ministerial ruling that saw criminals given visas \u2013 videoMinisterial direction 99 lists five \u201cprimary considerations\u201d. Issued in January last year, it updated the Morrison government\u2019s version, direction 90, which had four.Those were: the protection of the community; whether the offending conduct involved family violence; the best interests of minor children in the person\u2019s family; and community expectations.These conditions were numbered one to four in that order.At the instruction of Albanese, the immigration minister amended that \u2013 creating direction 99 \u2013 to add one further consideration: the \u201cstrength, nature and duration\u201d of the person\u2019s ties to Australia.He slotted it in at number three.The numbering and the fact that it was dropped into the middle of the list, not just added on at the end, indicate these considerations were meant to be weighted in that order. It suggests the government thought it more important than the two below it.That seems to be what the government intended. But it simply assumed that\u2019s how it would be read \u2013 the order does not spell it out.Instead, it says only that \u201cone or more primary considerations may outweigh other primary considerations\u201d. In other words, the deciders can weigh them up against one another and decide their relative importance. It doesn\u2019t say that number one is meant to be number one.But Watt\u2019s comments on Sunday suggest that\u2019s what the government intended.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was always our intention that community safety would be a primary consideration.\u201dWhat he means is that it was intended to be the primary consideration of the primary considerations. First among equals. Number one.But Guardian Australia understands decision-makers viewed them as being equal because nothing expressly ranked them in priority order. The direction was not clear on this point.Possibly supporting the suggestion that the government thought they would be seen as being ranked in order, the \u201cother considerations\u201d are listed differently.These are not numbered. They are listed by bracketed letters \u2013 a, b, c, etc \u2013 suggesting they\u2019re a bunch of equal also-ran factors.On that list are: any legal consequences of the decision; the extent of impediments if the person is removed; the impact on victims; and the impact on Australian business interests.The existing direction 99, which runs to 24 pages, also lays out detailed principles the decision-makers should follow in weighing the considerations.\u201cIn some circumstances, the nature of the non-citizen\u2019s conduct, or the harm that would be caused if the conduct were to be repeated, may be so serious that even strong countervailing considerations may be insufficient to justify not cancelling or refusing the visa, or revoking a mandatory cancellation,\u201d the last listed principle says.To explain further, it suggests, for example, that in a case involving family violence where there is no evidence that the person poses a further risk, the community\u2019s expectations on such matters may nevertheless need to prevail. This suggests that even if the listed factors are meant to be weighted by their numbered order, sometimes if number two and number five align, they may outweigh number one.Common sense is not mentioned. The government assumed it was implied.Giles and Albanese have now indicated the soon-to-be revised version of ministerial direction 99 will put a premium on community protection. Giles has said it will also deal with \u201csome additional concerns that we see around victims and their families\u201d.Expect, at the very least, a line to be added saying the primary considerations should be weighted by their numbered order, which already has community protection first, if not placing it more expressly on its own. And the particular \u201cother\u201d consideration mentioning victims may now be either elevated to the first list or expressly emphasised within the second.Sometimes, even common sense requires clearer direction."}

Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are rising and enormous fossil fuel projects continue to be approved to meet domestic and international demand.While any reasonable person understands that Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, the truth is that we are still not doing enough to address the root cause of our rapidly warming planet. The IPCC \u2013 the world\u2019s authority on climate science \u2013 has very clearly demonstrated that the burning of coal, oil and gas is the primary cause of climate change. No matter which way you look at it, fossil fuels are cooking the planet.And right now Australian taxpayers are footing the bill to keep the fossil fuel industry on life support. According to the Australia Institute, the government collects more money from the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) than it does from the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT), a federal tax levied on petroleum, oil and gas projects in Australian waters. In 2022/23 the government collected nearly $2.3bn from the PRRT, less than half the $4.9bn generated from student loan repayments.In his National Press Club address in January 2024, Richard Denniss, the executive director of the Australia Institute, said: \u201cConsider the fact that in Norway they tax the fossil fuel industry and give kids free university education, in Australia we subsidise the fossil fuel industry and charge kids a fortune to go to university.\u201d And it\u2019s not just young people doing it tough. In 2020/21, nurses paid more than three times the income tax the gas industry paid in income tax and the PRRT combined. Clearly we have things backwards.The scientific reality is, regardless of the political spin used to justify the continued exploitation of fossil fuel reserves, the laws of physics will keep warming the planet until we stop pumping carbon into the atmosphere and begin cleaning up the mess. The situation is too far gone for renewable energy alone to save us. Pinning our hopes on carbon capture technology to justify the continued burning of fossil fuels is a disastrous gamble the world can\u2019t afford to take. So, are the climate wars really over, or has a new era of greenwashing just begun?We know exactly how to put the brakes on global warming \u2013 the IPCC has been saying it for at least 30 yearsEvents of recent years have graphically showcased how underprepared Australia is for the impacts we\u2019ve already experienced with 1.2C of global warming, let alone the conditions we will experience in the future. According to the United Nations Environment Program, there is a 90% chance that the continuation of current climate policies will result in 2.3C to 4.5C of global warming by the end of century, with a best estimate of 3.5C. This represents a catastrophic overshooting of the Paris agreement targets, highlighting just how far off track we really are. The lower limit of 1.5C is expected to be breached in the early 2030s, with 2C reached in the 2040s \u2013 within the lifetime of most people alive today.The consequences of such high levels of warming on the Australian way of life and on our national security, health and unique ecosystems are profound and immeasurable. To force our political leaders to do better, we need to wake up to the fact that we are the last generation that will experience the world as we know it today: the last to experience the tropical wonders of the Great Barrier Reef, summers uninterrupted by life-threatening storms, and the awe of wild places before they succumb irrevocably to the ravages of fire and intolerable heat.Australia is in peril, and yet the consequences of a warming planet on our sunburnt country are still poorly understood by most people outside of the scientific community, let alone by our government. In 2023 a national study of just over 4,000 Australians was published by Queensland\u2019s Griffith University showing a major disconnection between the scientific reality of climate change and the public\u2019s perception of the severity of the problem.\u2018As the third-largest exporter of fossil fuels, what Australia chooses to do over the next five years is critical for the stabilisation of the Earth\u2019s climate.\u2019 Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAPAlthough three-quarters of Australians surveyed accept that climate change is real, only 15% think it is an \u201cextremely serious\u201d problem right now. The poll showed that while close to a third of people believed climate change will be an issue in 2050, the urgency of addressing the problem was not appreciated.The most interesting result for me was that about a quarter of Australians do not understand or accept the science and the reality of the threats posed by climate change, identifying as deniers, sceptical or unconvinced. I would have expected this a decade ago, but surely these results don\u2019t reflect the reality of today \u2013 or do they?To get a sense of how representative the Griffith University study might be, I tracked down a 2023 global survey of views on climate change. To my surprise, this polling also showed a disturbing lack of awareness of the scientific reality of climate change more than half of the Australians surveyed claimed that the impacts in our region have not been severe, with a third of people believing that the media exaggerates the influence of global warming.These perceptions may help explain why governments remain committed to only advancing modest climate policies that have broad electoral appeal. People are willing to install solar panels on their roof if it saves them money on their power bills, but they switch off when the harder conversation around the urgency of shutting down the fossil fuel industry begins.Should Australia go nuclear? Why Peter Dutton's plan could be an atomic failure \u2013 videoMost people are willing to let the government kick that can down the road, as many Australians still don\u2019t consider climate change an urgent issue that personally affects them or even understand the reality of the threats we face as a nation \u2013 not in some distant future, but right now. Today.Meanwhile, those of us who do try to communicate the dangers of unmitigated climate change to the public feel like a broken record. We know exactly how to put the brakes on global warming \u2013 the IPCC has been saying it for at least 30 years.We need our politicians to listen and have the heart and the courage to do the right thing. But for them to do what they know is right, ordinary Australians need to care about the future of our planet and vote for leaders who reflect the values of our local communities. As our next federal election approaches, we need a critical mass of people willing to create a social tipping point that demands our leaders do better.What happens at the next federal election really matters. As the third-largest exporter of fossil fuels, what Australia chooses to do over the next five years is critical for the stabilisation of the Earth\u2019s climate. We still have a chance to determine how bad things get and which areas can be saved, but only if we genuinely reduce emissions. Photograph: Black IncThe most urgent thing we need to do is phase out our use of fossil fuels and invest heavily in renewables like our life depends on it. Because it does. What we do during the 2020s will make or break humanity\u2019s ability to live safely on the planet.We have world-class knowledge and know-how right here in Australia; we can do this if we have the political will.This is an edited extract from Quarterly Essay 94, Highway to Hell \u2013 Climate Change and Australia\u2019s Future, by Joelle Gergis, out now"}

It is also likely to be, yet again, the hottest year recorded as the climate crisis intensifies. The Guardian asked young climate activists around the world what they want from the elections and whether politics is working in the fight to halt global heating.Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Charlier, 23, BelgiumElection dates: 3\u2009June to 9 JuneAd\u00e9la\u00efde Charlier. Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA\u201cWe\u2019re scared, because we have worked really hard for the past five years as a movement to [focus attention on] the climate emergency,\u201d says Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Charlier. In the European Union elections, the parliament is anticipated to swing sharply towards rightwing parties that oppose climate action.She says the EU\u2019s green policies, some of which have already been blocked or weakened, are a scapegoat for the wider social change she sees as necessary to beat the climate crisis, but which are opposed by conservative groups. \u201cWe are questioning the norm and so I believe that this is a reaction to our vision, rather than to what [the policies] actually mean in our daily life.\u201dThe EU is often cited as a world leader on climate action. \u201cI really believe there are [EU] politicians who want to fight to be ambitious. But the reality is that we are failing on our 2030 emissions target and still have companies, such as TotalEnergies, who are creating huge fossil fuel projects across the world.\u201dPolitical inertia is seen as the biggest barrier to climate action and must be overcome, says Charlier, a political and social science graduate now at the College of Europe in Bruges. \u201cThroughout my activism, I have seen politics not working to face the climate emergency. But the definition of politics is to organise ourselves as a society and I still believe that reinforcing democracy is the best way for us to solve this problem together.\u201dShe says halting global heating is not a challenge of technology. \u201cClimate change has to be solved through systemic change \u2013 we have to change everything. Can we do this on the political level? We simply have to.\u201cWe are trying to take the role of engaged citizens and right now we are really trying to mobilise young people to go and vote, while knowing that it isn\u2019t enough. We will go and vote and actively hope for the best. But for the rest, we will fight for it. The climate movement started with the right to protest and we will continue to use it, because it\u2019s in our DNA.\u201dAdriana Calder\u00f3n, 21, MexicoElection date: 2 JuneIn the Mexico election, the candidates\u2019 campaign materials alone are a signal of how seriously they are taking the environment, says Adriana Calder\u00f3n, a 21-year-old youth climate activist.The country is littered with them, hanging from lamp-posts, bridges and telephone wires. One NGO estimates that, by the end of the election cycle, 25,000 tonnes of \u201celectoral garbage\u201d will have been discarded in Mexico City alone. All made of plastic. \u201cWe can know from there how it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Calder\u00f3n tells the Guardian.Mexico\u2019s nearly 100 million voters go to the polls on 2 June, in mass elections with thousands of seats at play. Seats in local, regional and state governments and the country\u2019s national congress are all up for grabs, as well as the presidency itself.Adriana Calder\u00f3n (right) embraces fellow climate activists during a protest at Cop28. Photograph: Peter Dejong/APIn the lead to replace Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador is Claudia Sheinbaum, his anointed successor. Much of his popularity was built on social projects funded by oil and gas exploitation. Environmentalists expect more of the same from Sheinbaum \u2013 ironically a former Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scientist.\u201cShe\u2019s going to try to stay on the same track as her current party, which is keep relying on Pemex [Mexico\u2019s state-owned petroleum company],\u201d says Calder\u00f3n. \u201cThey also want to explore lithium expansion with her through Pemex also, because lithium was nationalised in Mexico last year.\u201dAs the Guardian speaks to Calder\u00f3n, from her home in Morelos, just south of Mexico City, she is sweltering in the region\u2019s third heatwave of the year. Much of the country is gripped by water shortages. Last year, the west coast, a popular holiday destination, was battered by Hurricane Otis, the first category five storm ever to hit the country.Other candidates, such as the second-placed X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, have spoken more extensively on the environment, referring to increasing private investment in the energy transition and reversing state exploitation of oil and gas.A third candidate, Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez, has made more environmental promises but seems unlikely to win.That leaves Mexico\u2019s green voters stuck between a rock and a hard place. Calder\u00f3n says. \u201cI\u2019m still debating with my friends about this and with my colleagues on the climate sphere, because, you know, it\u2019s either going back to the old party which has some very bad things for the country or is it staying with the current government that is not helping climate at all?Lauren MacDonald, 23, UKElection date: 4 July\u201cWe desperately need a change to a government that is actually ready to take urgent action to tackle the climate crisis,\u201d says Lauren MacDonald, a campaigner with Uplift. \u201cCurrently, we have a [Conservative] government completely hell bent on expanding oil and gas production in the North Sea, despite the absolutely catastrophic impacts burning this oil would have on our planet.\u201dShe says ministers have failed to sufficiently drive up the home insulation and renewable energy that would cut both energy bills and carbon emissions: \u201cInstead, they are making matters worse by handing out billions of pounds in tax breaks to [oil companies].\u201dA critical issue is ensuring that workers currently in the fossil fuel industry can move to clean energy jobs, a so-called just transition, as seen in Germany and Spain, says MacDonald. She is from Scotland, the centre of the UK oil and gas industry.The climate justice campaigner Lauren MacDonald. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian\u201cThose workers and unions are right to be asking the big questions,\u201d she says. \u201cI think people are ready for a transition that puts workers and communities before the profit-driven energy giants.\u201dThe opposition Labour party has a huge lead in opinion polls ahead of the general election and has pledged to end new oil and gas exploration. \u201cLabour is talking a good talk, but we\u2019ll be looking very keenly at how that will be implemented,\u201d says MacDonald. \u201cThere will still be a huge role for the climate movement to play.\u201dShe sees no alternative to political action to halt global heating. \u201cThe UK political system is not exactly inspirational, but governments need to tackle the climate crisis, because we can\u2019t trust the oil and gas companies. Who else is going to do it?\u201dBut, she says, \u201cwhatever happens at the election, climate is not an issue that\u2019s going to be solved overnight. It is going to take every facet of society doing everything that we can to actually implement change.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionThe planet's most important stories.

It\u2019s definitely challenging.\u201dLeclercq says no climate activists want another term for Trump, who withdrew the US from the global UN climate agreement, but she says Biden\u2019s term has had flaws: \u201cBiden campaigned on ending the lease of federal lands for oil drilling but his track record is having given out more permits than Trump.\u201dShe says the presidential election really matters for her home state of Texas, which is simultaneously the heart of the US oil and gas industry, severely affected by worsening heatwaves and floods, and also a major renewable energy state.\u201cThe environmental impacts are severe, especially on communities of colour, but the state government isn\u2019t going to be progressive for the foreseeable future \u2013 the petrochemical industry has such a strong stronghold on our state,\u201d she says. \u201cSo federal environmental policies are extremely important \u2013 it\u2019s basically the only thing we have.\u201dLeclercq says lobbying and corporate donations dominate the US political system: \u201cWe have a so-called democracy but the biggest influence on our government is industry. People are making billions of dollars from the status quo and keep intending to do so.\u201cWe\u2019re trying our best to build people power and put on pressure, and I think that\u2019s all that we can do at the moment,\u201d she says. But she sees some hopeful signs: \u201cEverywhere I go, I see a growing concern for climate, including Republican-voting farm owners, people you don\u2019t think stereotypically care about climate. They\u2019re seeing the impacts of the climate crisis on their livelihood on their ranch.\u201dDisha Ravi, 25, IndiaElection dates: 19 April to 1 JuneDisha Ravi. Photograph: Jyothy Karat/The GuardianWith 970 million eligible voters and an election season spanning months, India liked to style its elections as the world\u2019s biggest exercise in democracy. But this year there was another complicating factor. The stifling heat.Politicians have collapsed on stage. News anchors have blacked out live on air. With turnout down across the country, politicians have called on officials to open polling stations at 6am so voters can avoid temperatures reaching, in some parts, 47C.\u201cDespite all of this, I don\u2019t think climate change has been an issue that the contesting political parties have been rallying about,\u201d says Disha Ravi, a 25-year-old Fridays For Future activist from Bengaluru.This year, most parties\u2019 manifestos at least mention climate breakdown. \u201cSo that is a huge change,\u201d says Ravi. \u201cBut it\u2019s not something that\u2019s being spoken about. It\u2019s not a voting issue as of yet.\u201dThe governing BJP party of prime minister Narendra Modi was the frontrunner, and appears, according to exit polls, to have won a commanding majority. They have \u201cmade a lot of promises\u201d, says Ravi, including net zero by 2070 and a beefed-up clean air programme.But their record is less positive. New coalmines, deforestation projects and environmentally destructive infrastructure plans have fuelled a boom India has enjoyed under their rule \u2013 the benefits of which has overwhelmingly accrued to the ultra-wealthy. And despite big talk on the environment, their manifesto was light on concrete measures.\u201cThey have no mention of coal in the whole text,\u201d says Ravi. India relies on coal for 45% of its power, according to the IEA.Other parties, including Congress, formerly India\u2019s longtime party of government, made bolder pledges. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve also, most importantly, addressed the fact that there have been landslides happening and there has been ice melting in the Himalayas,\u201d says Ravi. \u201cCongress importantly and CPI, they both mention that the deregulated environmental norms, especially the forest rights that have been deregulated by the BJP, are going to be undone.\u201d But with only an outside chance of victory, such pledges are worthless.The BJP\u2019s big idea, meanwhile, is \u201cLife\u201d. \u201cL-I-F-E, which expands to lifestyle for environment,\u201d is a plan to centre individual Indians\u2019 personal responsibility for climate, says Ravi. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s putting the onus on people whose per capita emission is so much, so incredibly marginal.\u201dIf the exit polls are correct, Modi will have won by a large margin, which fills Ravi with despair.\u201cI don\u2019t think we can handle another year of living like this.\u201d"}

The former US president appeared on Sunday in a taped interview on Fox & Friends, a friendly forum on the rightwing channel and in which he was served up a series of softball questions by a trio of Fox hosts.Throughout the interview, Trump derided the conviction, baselessly characterizing it as political weaponization of the US justice system, while thanking the Republican party for largely supporting him.\u201cPeople get it. It\u2019s a scam,\u201d he said, speaking of the trial. \u201cAnd the Republican party \u2026 they\u2019ve stuck together in this. They see it\u2019s a weaponization of the justice department of the FBI and that\u2019s all coming out of Washington.\u201dNearly all senior Republican leaders have vociferously defended Trump, echoing his claims the convictions were politically motivated, including the House Speaker, Mike Johnson, the House majority leader Steve Scalise, and the Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell. Since the verdict Trump campaign officials say they have also seen a funding boost of tens of millions of dollars in donations from supporters.Trump and the Fox News interviewers characterized the \u201cweaponization\u201d as similar to corruption in Latin American governments. He also claimed his attorney\u2019s objections were routinely denied through the trial, while the prosecution were given preferential treatment: all familiar attack lines and conspiracy theories that Trump has peddled for months.\u201cThese people are sick, they\u2019re sick, they\u2019re deranged,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThe enemy from within, they are doing damage in this country,\u201d claiming his political opponents want to \u201cquadruple\u201d taxes. He dismissed New York and Washington DC as partisan areas where Republicans receive \u201cvirtually no votes\u201d.He cited his campaign has received an influx of donations since the conviction, nearly $53m and claimed it has bumped his approval ratings in polls against Biden.A Reuters poll found one in 10 Republicans are less likely to vote for Trump following the conviction. A Morning Consult poll found 49% of independents and 15% of Republicans think Trump should end his presidential campaign as a result of the conviction.Over the course of the trial, Trump\u2019s position in head to head surveys with Joe Biden did not shift much as he frequently maintained a narrow lead over his Democratic opponent. Trump also kept performing strongly in the key swing states needed to win the 2024 race for the White House. Strategists from both the Trump and Biden campaigns will eagerly be watching fresh polls this week to see if the verdict has had any meaningful impact on Trump\u2019s support.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Trump on TrialStay up to date on all of Donald Trump\u2019s trials.

In 2022, while living on jobseeker, the then single mother took on a $250 loan with the payday lender so she could afford groceries. Three weeks later, when her first payment of $54 was direct debited, the loan had already blown out to $514.50 with fees added.\u201cI\u2019d be down to my last $60 and I\u2019d suddenly find it was gone because they\u2019d direct debited it out of my account,\u201d she says.Consumer groups allege Cigno, headed by the former super rugby player Mark Swanepoel, has targeted some of the poorest Australians with its promise of \u201cquick\u201d, \u201ceasy\u201d and \u201chassle-free\u201d cash. Instead, many say they have been dragged into unsustainable debt due to the high-fee loans.In May, the federal court ruled that the type of loan issued to Grace \u2013 and more than 100,000 others, who were collectively charged over $70m in fees \u2013 had contravened the National Credit Act by issuing loans without a credit licence and charging prohibited fees. The court ordered the business to no longer collect on the loans in response to a lawsuit from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.But this is not the first time Cigno, and its associated lender, BSF Solutions, have been found to have issued loans unlawfully, and some fear that the court\u2019s latest action won\u2019t be enough to stop Cigno targeting vulnerable people again.\u2018Whack-a-mole\u2019The federal court found Cigno and BSF Solutions had issued loans between July 2022 and December 2022 under its \u201cno upfront charge loan model\u201d and that this violated the credit act by issuing and collecting debts on loans without a credit licence.This was Asic\u2019s latest in a series of attempts to crack down on Cigno that stretch back to 2019.Each time Asic took action, the business would find new exemptions in the act that allow loans to be issued without a credit licence under certain conditions. Then it proceeded to charge the consumers exorbitant fees beyond what was allowed.In 2019, Asic issued a \u201cproduct intervention order\u201d, a short-term ban on a type of lending model being used by Cigno and an associated lender since 2014. It was the first time the regulator had used this power.The same year, Cigno and the then new lender, BSF Solutions, started issuing loans under a different model.When the regulator\u2019s successful lawsuit was launched in 2020, it said BSF Solutions was issuing more than 1,000 loans a day.Two years later, with the lawsuit still afoot, Asic issued another \u201cproduct intervention\u201d aimed at companies including Cigno. In January, the ban was extended to 2032.In the meantime Cigno and BSF Solutions changed tack again and began offering the so-called \u201cno upfront charges loan model\u201d, which was the subject of the most recent legal win.Cigno and BSF Solutions had conceded during legal proceedings that if an \u201caccount keeping fee\u201d charged weekly to consumers who took on a loan was considered a fee for the provision of credit, then it had engaged in credit activity.The judgment shows the account-keeping fees \u2013 which ranged from $5.95 to $28.50 a week \u2013 charged across the loans amounted to almost $34m.\u201cAsic is essentially having to do whack-a-mole with this company,\u201d says Jillian Williams, of the Indigenous Consumer Action Network, which supports consumers in northern Queensland.\u201cThese really are people living below the poverty line that have been targeted by this company, and our concern is that may continue while this entity exists in one form or another.\u201dDebt collection ramp-upAccording to Rose Bruce-Smith, a policy officer at the Consumer Action Law Centre, Cigno\u2019s loans have tended to range from $100 to $200. Some have been up to $1,000. With the fees added, borrowers end up repaying a much higher value than the original loan.\u201cWe had one caller who received a $200 loan and was requested to pay $1,600. Another caller had a loan for $200 and had paid $160. Cigno contacted them asking for $1,200 in account-keeping [fees],\u201d she says.In Grace\u2019s case, she took out two loans with Cigno. The first time, in 2020, she borrowed $250 to afford rent on a new property after escaping a violent relationship. She paid back $454.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, Cigno contacted her earlier this year, claiming she owned them $1,588.Grace sent a letter to Cigno shortly after demanding it cease trying to collect the money because it had issued her the loan without a credit licence. The business responded and offered to settle her debts for $540, but she refused to pay.In the lead-up to this year\u2019s federal court\u2019s judgment, consumer groups say they saw a ramping up of Cigno\u2019s debt collection activities.\u201cWe saw direct debits to Cigno in bank accounts again, and more people mentioning that Cigno is a debt that they\u2019re having to manage,\u201d Williams says.Guardian Australia has seen an email from one consumer who received an email offering a 35% discount on his loan if paid in full. It was sent two days before the federal court judgment was delivered.Grace also got an email from Cigno warning her that failure to pay the loan would result in an \u201cadverse mark\u201d on her credit file and would impact her ability to obtain credit in the future. She was offered a 35% discount on the total $1,588 debt they claimed she owed if she paid in full. She ignored the email. The next day the court ruled Cigno and BSF Solutions could no longer collect on the loans.New laws yet to be testedThe federal court also ruledthat Swanepoel, Cigno\u2019s director, could no longer be involved in credit activity by Cigno so long as it doesn\u2019t hold a licence.But in December, just two months after Asic launched its latest legal action, Cigno began operating under a new business, FTA Data Solutions, according to business documents lodged with Asic. The firm has a credit licence and is owned by Mark Swanepoel\u2019s brother Ryan Swanepoel, who was not the subject of Asic\u2019s legal action.Ryan Swaneopol and Cigno were contacted for comment, but did not respond before the deadline.FTA Data Solutions also runs Quickle, another payday lender which offers loans of up to $10,000. Cigno has in the past only offered loans of up to $1,000. But now the FTA Data Solutions website is advertising loans of up to $10,000.Bruce-Smith says that because the business has a credit licence there will be far more protection for consumers who take on loans with the company. By law, businesses who hold credit licences are required to assess consumer\u2019s financial situation before issuing loans, and adhere to the credit act.\u201cThat being said, we see so many bad outcomes with licensed people as well, so it\u2019s definitely not a panacea,\u201d Bruce-Smith says.Last year, the government passed anti-avoidance measures to stop companies that morph into new models in a bid to escape ASIC attempts to shut them down. Many of the submissions made pushing for the legislation urged its necessity specifically to stop Cigno. The new laws are yet to be tested.A spokesperson for Asic says it will continue to monitor the activities of Cigno to ensure its complying with the law and that the new anti-avoidance measures are another option for Asic to pursue in the future.Grace says she is relieved she\u2019ll no longer be chased for her loan, but she thinks more should be done.\u201cI do believe that everyone that has paid more than they should have should be entitled to compensation,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many people have gone through financial hardship because of these things.\u201d* Name has been changed"}

Pictures released by the Sun, a Murdoch-owned British tabloid newspaper, showed the couple smiling next to each other as Murdoch wore a yellow tie while Zhukova wore a long-sleeve white dress.Murdoch\u2019s fifth wedding comes a little over a year after reports emerged last April of him dating Zhukova four months after he ended his two-week long engagement to Ann Lesley Smith, a 67-year-old conservative radio host.Murdoch met Zhukova through a large family gathering hosted by his third ex-wife, Wendi Deng, to whom he was married for 14 years before their divorce in 2013.Her 42-year-old daughter, Dasha Zhukova, is a Russian-American art collector and philanthropist who was previously married to Roman Abramovich, a Russian oligarch and former owner of the Premier League football club Chelsea.Murdoch divorced his fourth wife, 67-year old actress and model Jerry Hall, in 2022.

In this collection you\u2019ll find something for every mood and occasion, including a luscious yet light butter chicken, a nourishing snapper curry and Shane Delia\u2019s slow-cooked lamb-shoulder curry.", "author": null, "url": "https://www.broadsheet.com.au/national/food-and-drink/article/six-recipes-when-only-curry-will-do?utm_source=guardian&utm_medium=partner_content&utm_campaign=week_2", "text": "\u201cCurry\u201d is one of the loosest words in the culinary lexicon. Popular in almost every country between Pakistan and Japan (and anywhere with a significant Indian diaspora, such as South Africa, the West Indies and Fiji) curries can be saucy or dry, sweet or savoury, spicy or mild, meaty or vegetarian. Most do not contain curry leaves, as you might think.  \nRegardless of this enormous range of possibilities, when you hear the word you pretty much know what you\u2019re in for: a meal that\u2019s satisfying, big on flavour and easy to eat (the knives can stay in the drawer). Here are seven of our go-tos when curry cravings strike. \nAmandeep Sharma\u2019s Butter Chicken\nAmandeep Sharma spent six years working at Melbourne\u2019s Attica, the best restaurant in the country, including almost four as a chef de partie. During his tenure, this dish was one of the most popular staff meals. We can see why. The yoghurt\u2019s gentle lactic tang and the lemon juice\u2019s sharper acidity are the perfect foils to the richness of the cream and tomatoes. This lovely balance makes this luscious curry lighter than you might expect. \nPatty Antico\u2019s Khao Soi \n\nAnyone who\u2019s been to Chiang Mai will know the joy of khao soi. The soupy, coconut milk-based red curry is one of northern Thailand\u2019s most iconic dishes. This particular version came to Australia 35 years ago with Thai expat Patty Antico, whose daughter Tania Fergusson co-owns Sydney\u2019s Automata and A1 Canteen. Like Sharma\u2019s butter chicken, it\u2019s one of the most popular staff meals at the two restaurants. Regardless of whether you\u2019re a hospo worker pulling long shifts, khao soi\u2019s hearty mix of chicken, sharp red onion, pickled mustard greens and filling egg noodles is easy to appreciate.\nTwo Good Co\u2019s Snapper Curry With Brown Rice and Pumpkin \n\nSydney\u2019s Two Good Co is a social enterprise that provides meals and work to domestic violence survivors. As much as possible, it focuses on comforting, nourishing food \u2013 such as this curry, which contains turmeric, ginger and a rainbow of vegetables. It\u2019s a simpler version of a fish-curry recipe head chef Jane Strode learned at Neil Perry\u2019s Rockpool when she was just starting her hospitality career. \u201cIt was cooked to order with coral trout,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019d serve it with fresh semolina noodles and lightly blanched vegetables. The lid would come off the pot, and the customer would get a hit of fragrance.\u201d\nSara Oteri\u2019s Sri Lankan-Style Lamb Curry With Basmati Rice\n\nThis fragrant curry takes two hours to cook, but demands just 15 minutes of prep time. Like many curries, it also uses just a single pot. And the third and final big tick? A similar balance to Sharma\u2019s butter chicken, courtesy of natural yoghurt, lime juice and coconut flakes. Your house is going to smell so, so good.\nShane Delia\u2019s Lamb-Shoulder Curry With Green Pea Basmati Rice\n\nYou\u2019ve met roast lamb, and lamb curry. Now meet their well-endowed offspring: Shane Delia\u2019s roast lamb curry. This is the kind of frankenfood we can get behind. The lamb is marinated in garlic and cumin for five hours, then plonked in a coconut milk curry and cooked for more than four hours until it\u2019s a burnished golden brown. The final touch? Finely grated macadamias, to make the lamb look like it\u2019s \u201cbeen sprinkled with snow\u201d. Very nice stuff from the host of SBS\u2019s Spice Journey and the owner of Melbourne\u2019s Maha.\nGriff Pamment\u2019s Thai Red-Curry Soup\n\nThe former executive chef at shuttered Sydney institution Longrain makes this quick, warming cross between curry and laksa when he goes camping. At home, in an actual kitchen, it\u2019s a cinch and sacrifices nothing on flavour. The dish is vegetarian and gets its bulk from pumpkin, but you can easily throw in some seared chicken or another meat of your choosing. \nHugh Allen\u2019s Marron Curry\n\nThis rich, bisque-like curry, from the executive chef at Melbourne fine diner Vue de Monde, marries Southeast Asian flavours with Aussie ingredients: marron heads, barramundi bones and Tasmanian mountain pepper. Clocking in at two and a half hours, this is a definite weekend project, but there\u2019s commensurate satisfaction to be gained in nailing the four sub-recipes: coconut and cauliflower puree, blanched marron heads, marron and saffron paste, and finally the curry itself."}

six people convicted of offences in the category \u201cintentional or reckless injury or assault occasioning actual bodily harm\u201d; and three convicted of \u201carmed robbery, aggravated burglary, robbery or burglary\u201d.Several of the 25 had no criminal conviction; many were convicted of fraud, \u201cother non-violent offences\u201d, or lower level offences, such as common assaults.Despite at least 16 people having been released by Labor, the home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, has said on several occasions since November \u201cif it were up to [her]\u201d the entire NZYQ cohort would \u201cstill be in detention\u201d or would never have been released.On Friday, Guardian Australia contacted the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, and O\u2019Neil to ask which government and minister released the 25 people on residence determinations.Asked to rule out that the Albanese government had released those convicted of serious offences, a spokesperson said: \u201cThe government does not comment on ongoing court matters.\u201d\u201cThe commonwealth is arguing strongly that electronic monitoring and curfews are necessary for community safety,\u201d the spokesperson said.On Wednesday, Australian Border Force officials revealed at Senate estimates at least two murderers or attempted murderers and 26 sex offenders released as a result of the high court decision were not required to wear an electronic ankle monitor or observe a curfew.Albanese announces reversal of ministerial ruling that saw criminals given visas \u2013 videoThe ABF commissioner, Michael Outram, defended the regime by saying there was a \u201cbig difference between some murders and other murders\u201d.Outram noted that offences \u201ccould be years ago\u201d, as well as differences in the \u201crehabilitation\u201d or prospects of rehabilitation of the person, and the potential risk of reoffending.The Albanese government has been under sustained criticism from the Coalition over both its handling of those released as a result of the NZYQ high court ruling and an unrelated ministerial direction on visa cancellation which defines a non-citizen\u2019s ties to Australia as a \u201cprimary consideration\u201d.Labor has vowed to replace direction 99 with an order that community safety is paramount and outweighs a non-citizen\u2019s ties to Australia.On Thursday, Giles revealed that drones were used to assist with surveillance of those released as a result of the NZYQ ruling. The home affairs department later clarified this was done to confirm the location of their accommodation and identify nearby facilities that may be relevant to their visa conditions.In November, O\u2019Neil sought to explain the government\u2019s difficulty responding to the high court decision by saying it was \u201ca little bit unusual\u201d for the court to make a decision without explaining its reasons for decision.But a submission to Giles, released under freedom of information, shows that on 6 November, one day before the two-day hearing, he was warned if NZYQ won the case, the court \u201cmay make orders that he be released immediately from immigration detention\u201d.O\u2019Neil has said the government was advised it would probably win the case or be able to deport NZYQ, but the department rejected an FoI claim for the relevant \u201coperational advice\u201d by claiming she had relied on verbal advice only.The 6 November submission is at best equivocal on the point, suggesting there was \u201csufficient viability\u201d in the option of deporting NZYQ to the US to argue the point in court, but describing the resettlement only as \u201cpossible\u201d.It said that \u201clegal risks for the commonwealth\u201d were addressed in an email to \u201cboth portfolio ministers\u2019 offices (dated 22 August 2023)\u201d."}

Over his first and only spring, in a town stalked by hunger, he wasted away to a shadow of a child, skin stretched painfully over jutting bones.In seven months of life, he had little time to make a mark beyond the family who loved him. But when his death from malnutrition was reported last week, it sounded a warning around the world about a rapidly deepening crisis in central and southern Gaza, triggered by the Israeli military operation in the southern town of Rafah.At least 30 child victims of malnutrition have been recorded in Gaza, but almost all died in the north, until recently the area with the most extreme shortages of food and medical care, where a top US aid official said famine had taken hold in some areas.The arrival of Israeli troops in Rafah in May shifted the grim calculus of threat in the strip.\u201cThe ongoing situation in Rafah is a disaster for children,\u201d said Jonathan Crickx, chief of communication for Unicef in Palestine. \u201cIf nutrition supplies, especially ready-to-use therapeutic food, used to address malnutrition among children, cannot be distributed, the treatment of more than 3,000 children with acute malnutrition will be interrupted.\u201dThe body of Fayiz Abu Ataya, who died due to malnutrition, is brought to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al Balah, Gaza, on 30 May. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesFor months, northern Gaza, cut off by an Israeli military cordon, had been hungrier than the south. Aid mostly trickled into the strip through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, and the Kerem Shalom gateway from Israel.Now the border with Egypt is controlled by Israeli troops, the Rafah crossing is closed, and fighting has choked shipments of humanitarian aid through Kerem Shalom. The supply of humanitarian aid into Gaza overall has dropped by two-thirds since 7 May, when the operation began, UN figures showed last week.Much of the food still getting into Gaza is shipped to the north through new crossings, meaning the crisis there has eased, but people in the south are running out of supplies, the World Food Programme chief for Palestine said.\u201c[In the north,] it is a situation that has improved significantly from five weeks ago,\u201d said Matthew Hollingworth. \u201cOn the other side, in the middle and in particular the south, what we\u2019ve seen just since 7\u00a0May is the situation begin to deteriorate again.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a week or so before people will genuinely run out of all assistance they were able to receive through April and the start of May.\u201dA floating pier built by the US and able to funnel shipments either north or south was damaged by bad weather and is expected to be out of operation for several more days at least.An Israeli missile strike that sparked a blaze among crowded refugee tents last weekend, killing at least 45 people, was a grim demonstration of the urgent threat to civilians from bombs and bullets during the operation in Gaza.Collapsing access to food and medical care may be a slower-motion tragedy, but one that threatens almost everyone in the south of the enclave now. Twenty international aid agencies warned last week that \u201cthe unpredictable trickle of aid into Gaza has created a mirage of improved access while the humanitarian response is in reality on the verge of collapse\u201d.They now fear \u201can acceleration in deaths from starvation, disease and denied medical assistance\u201d, the groups, including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, Oxfam and Save the Children said in a joint statement.On Saturday, another child death from malnutrition was recorded in Deir al Balah, a 13-year-old. Those two losses in a week are probably an indicator of a much greater emergency.\u201cIn similar crises around the world, according to Unicef experience, usually children don\u2019t die from malnutrition and dehydration in hospitals, they die at home, in the street or where they have taken shelter,\u201d Crickx said. \u201cThis means reported deaths of children from malnutrition only show part of the whole toll. There is a reasonable concern that in Gaza too, there are significant numbers of children affected by malnutrition who are not represented in reported figures.\u201dMost children under five in Gaza are spending entire days without eating anything at all. A snapshot survey, looking at food access over three days in May, found that 85% spent at least one day without food, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionA view of the floating pier, set up by the US to facilitate delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians, after it was suspended due to adverse weather conditions and rising sea levels in Gaza City on 27 May. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesLack of food is not the only risk. Lack of clean water and sanitation also means that children are at far greater risk of getting infectious diseases, which are particularly dangerous to the very young. The closure of most hospitals and clinics, damage to those still operating and severe overcrowding means parents struggle to access even basic care for gastrointestinal illness, let alone the close monitoring and treatment needed to recover from malnutrition.Save the Children said there is no longer any route for them to carry out medical evacuations of children who need urgent treatment outside Gaza.After heavy pressure over aid shortages from the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally, and a ruling from the international court of justice that Israel must do more to address the humanitarian catastrophe, the country has opened new crossings for aid.Israeli authorities say there is no limit on the supplies that can be sent into Gaza, blame hunger on logistics failures by humanitarian groups, and give figures for trucks of aid into Gaza that are higher than UN data.\u201cIsrael is committed to abide by our obligations according to international law and our stated policy that there is no limit on the amount of humanitarian aid that we are willing to accept,\u201d said Shimon Freedman, spokesman for Cogat, the Israeli body responsible for humanitarian coordination.He said the average daily number of trucks into Gaza had increased in May to around 350 compared with around 300 in April, adding: \u201cI know that there have been other numbers publicised by different organisations, but those numbers do not represent the full picture.\u201dHumanitarians have described the focus on truck numbers as misleading because there is no standard for either truck size, how to count full or partial loads, or where they should be counted. Israel counts trucks passing into Kerem Shalom, including some that are not fully loaded, while the UN counts only those arriving in Gaza fully loaded.\u201cIt\u2019s almost a fool\u2019s game to do the truck counting,\u201d OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said on Friday. The focus instead should be on what supplies are getting into Gaza, and then reaching those in need, he added.Humanitarian groups say a set of security requirements and logistical challenges \u2013 which may not seem insurmountable in isolation \u2013mean it is practically impossible to deliver sufficient aid. These include capacity for Israeli security checks at all borders, to getting permission from the military to move around inside Gaza. The Norwegian Refugee Council described efforts to reach the most vulnerable people in Gaza as \u201ca giant game of snakes and ladders\u201d, in which staff make \u201cvery small steps forward and then end up back at square one\u201d.\u201cIf humanitarian supplies are allowed into Gaza, we might not have fuel with which to transport them. When we have fuel, we may not have cash with which to pay for trucks,\u201d it said. \u201cThe day we can pay for trucks, the roads to the warehouse could be too dangerous to travel. And if we can get to the warehouse, the staff on whom we depend to load cargo could have fled when the explosions came too close.\u201dIn March, a coalition of aid groups had warned that famine was imminent in northern Gaza with people suffering \u201ccatastrophic levels of hunger\u201d.The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) group said southern parts of Gaza would also face a risk of famine in a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d, which included the invasion of Rafah now underway.The WFP\u2019s Hollingworth called for urgent action to prevent that becoming a reality. \u201cBy the time famine is declared it\u2019s already too late, there are already too many deaths,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not necessarily too late in the south and centre of Gaza, but we have to act now.\u201d"}

Hamas says they want a ceasefire. This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it. Hamas needs to take the deal,\u201d he said.But in remarks on Saturday, Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, immediately undermined Biden, reiterating that Israel seeks the complete destruction of the Palestinian militant group before it will agree to ending the war. Any deviation from that condition is a \u201cnon-starter\u201d, he said.Hamas provisionally welcomed the president\u2019s announcement, although it also said as recently as Thursday that it still views a full withdrawal of Israeli troops as a precondition to talks.As expected, Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition partners \u2013 the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, and the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir \u2013 immediately voiced opposition to the new truce plan when Shabbat ended on Saturday night, threatening to resign if it goes ahead.Such a deal would be \u201cfoolhardy, constituting a victory for terrorism and a threat to Israel\u2019s national security,\u201d Ben-Gvir, the head of the ultranationalist Jewish Power party, said on X.An aide to the prime minister confirmed on Sunday that Israel had put the framework forward, but described it as \u201cflawed\u201d and in need of more work.However, Netanyahu is also under increasing pressure from his military and intelligence chiefs, as well as the centrist members of his war cabinet, to accept a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Benny Gantz, a leading rival who joined Netanyahu\u2019s emergency unity government after 7 October, has said he will resign if the prime minister does not commit to a \u201cday after\u201d plan for Gaza by 8\u00a0June.Yair Lapid, Israel\u2019s opposition leader, also urged Netanyahu to agree to a hostage and ceasefire deal, saying his centrist Yesh Atid party would support it even if rightwing factions in the government rebelled \u2013 meaning a deal would be likely to pass in parliament.\u201cThe government of Israel cannot ignore President Biden\u2019s consequential speech. There is a deal on the table and it should be made,\u201d he said on Saturday.Netanyahu, long plagued by corruption charges he denies, sees staying in office as his best chance of avoiding prosecution, as well as putting off investigations and hearings into the security failures that contributed to Hamas\u2019s 7 October assault.During Saturday night\u2019s now-weekly protest in Tel Aviv led by the families of hostages held by Hamas, thousands of people called on the government to act on the new proposal. A joint statement from ceasefire mediators the US, Egypt and Qatar said the three countries \u201cjointly call on both Hamas and Israel to finalise the agreement \u2026 [to] bring immediate relief both to the longsuffering people of Gaza as well as the longsuffering hostages and their families\u201d.Despite Biden\u2019s description of the peace deal as an Israeli proposal, the president\u2019s speech \u2013 his most pointed call to date for the war to end \u2013 appeared to be designed to pressure the Israeli government into coming to the table, as well as Hamas.On Sunday, the White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said in an interview with ABC News: \u201cWe have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal as was transmitted to them, an Israeli proposal \u2013 then Israel would say yes.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was clearly speaking directly to the Israeli people.\u201dFriday\u2019s announcement is the third \u201clast-ditch\u201d ceasefire proposal endorsed by the US: in February, a Ramadan ceasefire that Biden said was \u201cvery close\u201d did not materialise, and some progress towards a new truce last month was scuppered by the launch of Israel\u2019s invasion of Rafah, the last pocket of Gaza to be spared ground fighting.There is only one substantial difference between the new plan and previous proposals: the first phrase, which is a six-week ceasefire in which a limited number of Israeli hostages would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, would be indefinitely extendable while negotiators thrash out the next stage.In phase two, all remaining hostages would be released, Israel would completely withdraw from Gaza, and both parties would commit to a lasting truce. The third phrase is supposed to implement as-yet unspecified plans for Gaza\u2019s future, including administration and reconstruction.About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Hamas\u2019s assault on 7 October, with a further 250 taken hostage: about 100 were released in a week-long ceasefire in November.More than 36,000 people have been killed by Israel in the war in Gaza \u2013 according to the Palestinian health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths \u2013 which has decimated the strip\u2019s infrastructure, displaced 85% of the population from their homes and created a dire humanitarian crisis. Israel\u2019s decision to invade Rafah last month has significantly disrupted aid deliveries, leading relief organisations to again warn of widespread famine.Biden\u2019s initial full-throated support for Israel\u2019s right to defend itself after the 7 October attack has given way to censure of the suffering and death in Gaza after widespread criticism at home over his position on the war. However, the US remains the Jewish state\u2019s most important ally and principal weapons supplier.Being seen to broker an end to the conflict in Gaza would be a foreign policy boon for the president, who is facing an uphill battle for re-election in November."}

The government last week confirmed a new direction would be issued.\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now is making it absolutely crystal-clear for the AAT and departmental officials interpreting it that community safety is to be the number one priority, more than anything else,\u201d Watt said.Under direction 99 the strength, nature and duration of ties to Australia are considered alongside four other \u201cprimary considerations\u201d: protecting the community, \u201cwhether the conduct engaged in constituted family violence\u201d, the interests of children and expectations of the Australian community.Albanese announces reversal of ministerial ruling that saw criminals given visas \u2013 videoWatt said the AAT had interpreted direction 99 in a way the government hadn\u2019t intended, with a person\u2019s ties to Australia being considered too highly. He said the government didn\u2019t mean \u201cfor community safety to be relegated below that as a priority\u201d.\u201cWhat would have been a mistake is if the government had said that we want to put duration of stay above community safety and we didn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said.The new direction is yet to be shared publicly. Government sources said it was likely to be finalised in coming days. It will be issued by the minister, and not require legislative change.Watt also hit back at criticisms from the Coalition, claiming visa cancellation rates were lower since Labor had come to office, and that Labor had \u201cdeported more criminals in our first year in office than the government ever did under Peter Dutton\u2019s reign\u201d.Watt confirmed again the government was using drones to monitor immigration detainees released under the NZYQ high court verdict. There had been confusion last week after immigration minister Andrew Giles said drones were being used in the government\u2019s response \u201cto keep track of people\u201d. SBS reported on Friday that many police services and security agencies had either said they weren\u2019t operating the drones, or declined to comment.Watt said the drones were being used \u201cin an operational sense\u201d.\u201cMy understanding is that drones are being used as part of this operation, but more in the sense of monitoring the accommodation people are living in, for example, ensuring that it\u2019s not too close to schools or other areas that they\u2019re not supposed to be living close to,\u201d he said.skip past newsletter promotionOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This imagery can also assist identify facilities in proximity of the accommodation that may be relevant to an individual\u2019s visa conditions,\u201d the spokesperson said.Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, shadow home affairs minister James Paterson questioned the use of drones.\u201cYou don\u2019t need a drone to do that. That sounds like satellite imagery. It sounds like, frankly, something a 12-year-old would get on Google Earth.\u201cEither Andrew Giles accidentally and casually disclosed a previously secret drone surveillance program operating domestically in Australia \u2026 Or he made it up and it\u2019s not actually happening at all,\u201d he said.An Australian Border Force spokesperson last week said it does not comment on \u201cthe specifics of its operational capability or that of its law enforcement partners\u201d but that federal authorities were \u201cworking closely with state and territory authorities and law enforcement to ensure community safety\u201d.\u201cThe use of surveillance technology by law enforcement agencies is governed by strict legislative requirements,\u201d the ABF said."}

I was intrigued, but sceptical. At Broadsheet, we take these sorts of hacks with a Salt Bae-sized pinch of salt. And for good reason. \nRemember that viral video of a knife sliding into a full head of garlic and popping out clove after clove? Mostly BS. Jamie Oliver\u2019s suggestion to turn your toaster on its side to make a melted-cheese sandwich? Highly dangerous, according to the London Fire Brigade. \nOn her Youtube channel How to Cook That, Melbourne-based cook Ann Reardon has recently begun debunking bogus food hacks such as these, garnering millions of views. Sadly, she doesn\u2019t seem to have covered this one yet. \nWith no concrete evidence about the merits of the lemon-juicing hack, I only have one logical course of action: buy a lemon and give it a skewering. \nThe test\nFirst, I subject the lemon to a few firm, rolling-pin-style motions with my hand, to loosen the juice inside. \nThen, with a wooden skewer, I pierce the lemon\u2019s nipple-like end and stop just short of kebab-ing it. (This is crucial. Otherwise, you\u2019ll end up with an unruly, two-pronged lemon fountain. I learned the hard way.)\nI remove the skewer and start squeezing the lemon with a full fist. After a few pulses: nothing. Has the internet done me dirty? I continue. \nThen, almost out of nowhere, a jet of lemon juice. And another. As the bowl starts to fill, I realise this is the closest I\u2019ll probably ever come to milking a cow \u2013 the lemon like an udder, the juice like fresh milk.  \nThe result\nUn \ud83d\udc4f deniable \ud83d\udc4f success \ud83d\udc4f !\nThe ridiculously simple skewer method produces 50 millilitres of zingy, pip-free lemon juice. And it\u2019s just as effective when I try it with a metal skewer and a sharp-pointed chopstick. \nFor comparison, I roll and juice an identically sized lemon with a citrus squeezer and it produces just 43 millilitres.\nThe pros\n\u2022   No need for a citrus squeezer, reamer, handheld lever press or any other juicing contraption.\n\u2022   Marginally more liquid for your labour (seven millilitres, in this case).\n\u2022   Increased capacity for on-the-go juicing.\n\u2022   Less chance of pesky pip slips in salad dressings, marinades, teas, cocktails et al.\n\u2022   A great alternative to finger-straining said pips.\n\u2022   Works just as well with limes.\n\u2022   A use for skewers that isn\u2019t cooking shish kebabs, checking if your cake is properly baked or opening your phone\u2019s sim-card slot.\n\u2022   Decreased Tiktok-related self-loathing. \nThe cons\n\u2022   Unsuitable for juicing in large quantities (RSI may result).\n\u2022   Significantly less effective with oranges."}

A bush-filled block of land that backs onto a national park, the farm featured river frontage and four hectares of red grapevines. \u201cIt\u2019s a really stunning property,\u201d she says. \u201cWe fell in love with it.\u201d\nAlexandra bought the property before embarking on \u201ca very steep learning curve to work out how to run the vineyard\u201d she says. The work paid off. Today Little Cathedral is an exclusively pinot noir vineyard, renowned for its award-winning wines.Never miss a Melbourne moment. Make sure you're subscribed to our newsletter today.SUBSCRIBE NOW\n\u201cIt was a very good decision by the original owners [to plant only one grape variety] because pinot noir has been a really popular wine right through,\u201d says Alexandra. \u201cIt\u2019s been in demand the whole time we\u2019ve owned the vineyard.\u201d\nAlexandra is unperturbed by the grape variety\u2019s reputation for fussiness. \u201c[Pinot noir is] supposedly the winemakers\u2019 grape,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest to grow, but I don\u2019t know anything else. You\u2019ve got to really look after the vines. The more carefully you pick them, the better wine you produce from them.\u201d\nAlthough it\u2019s a small wine district with just six wineries, the Little Cathedral\u2019s patch of the Upper Goulburn is particularly well-suited to growing pinot noir. \u201cIt\u2019s a proper cool-climate area,\u201d says Alexandra. \u201cWe\u2019re up in the hills and close to 300-metres elevation. We get a lot of cold nights, and that\u2019s really favourable for growing pinot.\u201d\nAlexandra\u2019s debut 2015 vintage benefitted from an ideal season \u2013 a good spring and summer with rain at the right time, which caused the fruit to ripen evenly, \u201cso the balance of tannins and acids were right,\u201d says Alexandra.\nThe resulting Little Cathedral 2015 Pinot Noir is a robust wine that pairs well with strong flavours such as duck and truffle. It took out a raft of awards, including the Fagan Trophy and Gold Medal at the Australian Single Vineyard Wine Show and a gold medal at the Royal Melbourne Show.\n\u201cOur pinot was the only one out of the Yarra Valley or the Mornington Peninsula that won a gold medal [at the Royal Melbourne Show],\u201d says Alexandra. \u201cI was really proud of that. We\u2019re not a well-known region, but we produce really good fruit and really good wine. There are a number of people in the Yarra Valley starting to cotton on to the fact that we have a better climate up here for pinot.\u201d\nPinot noir is picked early in the season in March, which this year coincided with the introduction of social distancing measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWe were just about to harvest when it started going pear-shaped,\u201d says Alexandra. \u201cWe always get contractors to come up and pick \u2013 I was nervous we wouldn\u2019t get our pickers, and that would be a disaster.\u201d\nFortunately, they finished picking Little Cathedral\u2019s fruit before the lockdown came into effect. Since then, it\u2019s been \u2013 relatively \u2013 business as usual. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re pruning and doing maintenance work,\u201d says Alexandra. \u201cWe can do social distancing [here] \u2013 it\u2019s an advantage we\u2019re not in a metropolitan area.\u201d\nLittle Cathedral has also taken advantage of an initiative from First Choice Liquor Market, which sees small local producers invited to be stocked in their stores.\n\u201cIt really helps our exposure and availability to the wider public,\u201d says Alexandra. \u201cThere seems to be a growing demand by people to buy locally produced products. [They] want to know where their wine is being grown and produced, and they\u2019re interested in knowing they\u2019re supporting local small businesses. Particularly during this second wave of lockdown in Victoria, it\u2019s important for Victorians to help each other. Buying Victorian wine is mutually beneficial.\u201d\nThe pandemic has also meant Alexandra, who usually splits her time between Little Cathedral and Melbourne, has been spending a lot more time in the country, a lifestyle she enjoys. \u201cI love living in the hills,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve made some good friends, and it\u2019s so peaceful.\u201d\nKeen to raise your glass to a local producer?
