    "text": "Shabaka on his shakuhachi: ‘The way it makes you feel is unsurpassed by any other instrument’A central figure of the London jazz scene, Shabaka Hutchings, 40, has been a member of bands including Shabaka and the Ancestors, and the Mercury-nominated Sons of Kemet and The Comet Is Coming. He announced last year that he would no longer be playing the saxophone live. For his solo debut album, Perceive Its Beauty, Acknowledge Its Grace, released on Impulse! in April, he uses different types of flute and the clarinet. This summer and autumn Shabaka tours the US, Canada and Europe, including the Montreal international jazz festival. He is pictured here with a shakuhachi, a traditional Japanese bamboo fluteThis is one of the more difficult instruments to play that I own. It was given to me by an instrument-maker and shakuhachi player in Japan, Katsuya Nonaka. A year and a half ago, I travelled to Japan to meet him to talk about harvesting and making my own shakuhachi. We went to a bamboo forest and started the process of selecting the bamboo – it had to be the right age because of the moisture, and had to be suitable for my hand – and we dug it out of the ground from the roots. Then you burn the shakuhachi to get the initial oil out, and you leave it to cure for a year. I went back a year later and finished the process: I made three shakuhachis, and harvested four more on that trip. I’ll be going back to Japan later this year for the process of boring the holes and making the mouthpiece for those. By December, I should have made seven instruments.It is daunting to go to an instrument as a complete beginner. It took me a year to make a consistent sound on itWhile I was waiting for those first bamboos to cure, Katsuya gave me one of his own shakuhachis, which is the one in the picture. I’ve had shakuhachis before, but this is the biggest, and the most difficult to play. This is purely a practice instrument: I never play it live, and didn’t use it on the new album – on the tune Insecurities, I use an antique, 100-year-old shakuhachi. This is a private tool for me. I’ll warm up on it if I’m doing long tones in the morning or breathwork. Paradoxically, a bigger instrument doesn’t mean it is louder. But in terms of the low frequencies, it’s really pleasurable to play.I got my first shakuhachi in Japan in 2019, when I was at the Fuji rock festival. I’d heard about it before and knew it had a cool sound, but I was very much an outsider. It is daunting and really humbling to go to an instrument and be a complete beginner. It took me a year to make a consistent sound on it; to put it to my lips and know, this is the sound I’m going to get. When I managed, it felt really great. There’s something really pleasurable about being able to sit with such a low vibration noise. When it’s resonating correctly, the way it makes you feel is, for me, unsurpassed by any other instrument I’ve played. There isn’t any mechanism or technology: it’s just one piece of material.Shabaka with his shakuhachi. Photograph: Amit LennonThe shakuhachi was used by Buddhist monks as a meditation tool for many centuries before it was a performative device. You can see why: there’s something very centring and grounding about it. Katsuya told me about a technique that’s been passed down to him, which is playing the lowest note for a couple of hours, thinking about how the note emerges from nothing to something and then back to nothing. This instrument in particular is great for that: to sit with long tones for long periods of time and just bliss out.Is the flute having a moment? It’s an interesting question. Lizzo’s been playing the flute for a while – she plays the classical flute. André 3000 [who last November released the flute-centred album New Blue Sun] concentrates on the Native American flute variety. The thing with the flute is that it’s cathartic. It’s one of the oldest instruments: I guess the voice is the first, and then maybe percussion elements, but when it comes to actually using a part of the natural environment to amplify the sound you’re hearing in your head, the flute’s the oldest instrument that they found. From all the conversations I’ve had with André, it feels like that’s the vibe: you pick up the flute, make little melodies, and discover what the flute has to tell you.I’m not playing saxophone any more, but in the past year or so I was practising so much shakuhachi that it really increased my saxophone technique. It develops the muscles around your mouth a lot more than the sax does – it’s a very small focused stream of air that forces you to get very in tune with what your body is doing. What I found in going to the flute from the saxophone and clarinet is that it feels better to inhabit the quieter dynamic realm – it’s almost more natural. It means I can be out in public, in nature, and be playing to myself without feeling that my sound is dominating the space.A lot of the practise I do is in the bathroom – the tiling means you get a nice reverb, and it’s good to look at the mirror to see what my technique’s doing – or I’ll be playing in hotel fire exits. So it’s been good to actually perform live with a microphone. Actually, at the moment, I put three mics in front of the flute, so I can get triple the amount of level. I’m not actually playing very loud at all, but I’m able to project over a large distance. That’s something I saw in a Björk interview, when she was talking about [her album] Vespertine, and amplifying very quiet sounds so that they become big gestures. I’m really looking forward to doing a 12-gig, six-night residency at the Blue Note jazz club in New York this September. It’s the first time I’ll have done six nights in one club: it means I’ll really understand the space and how to manipulate the resonance.If this shakuhachi got lost or broken, it would be pretty tragic. Any of these instruments that are made by specific pieces of bamboo, they’re irreplaceable – you’ll never get a piece of bamboo exactly the same. All my instruments are very specific to me in terms of what they mean, and the stories behind them, and how much time I’ve spent on each of them. So if I lost one, that’s the end of my story with that instrument. But if an instrument-sized hole appears in my life, there are always other instruments that come to the rescue. Kathryn BromwichCorinne Bailey Rae on her Marxophone: ‘I like that it doesn’t feel competitive. It’s very tactile, you can get straight to it’Corinne Bailey Rae with her Marxophone. Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverBorn in Leeds in 1979, Corinne Bailey Rae is best known for her soulful early singles Like a Star and Put Your Records On, which propelled her self-titled debut album to a UK No 1 in 2006. Lately her sound has become more raucous and experimental: her 2023 album Black Rainbows was described in a five-star Observer review as an “audacious mix of rock, electronica, jazz and Afrofuturism”. She lives in Leeds with her musician husband Steve Brown and their two daughters. This summer she is playing a slew of festivals including Glastonbury (29 June), Latitude (26 July) and We Out Here (17 August)In 2007, shortly after my first album came out and I had a bit of cash in my pocket, I went into a vintage guitar shop in Los Angeles. Those kinds of places always scare me, because I’m not a technical guitarist and the people who work there are usually dudes. There were all these expensive guitars hanging up, and then there was this strange-looking instrument on a shelf, called a Marxophone. I asked if I could try it and the guy looked at me as if to say “another timewaster who wants to check this out but won’t actually buy it”. I played it for a while and he gave me another look and I took great pleasure in saying: “Yeah, I’ll take it.”The Marxophone was patented by an American inventor called Henry Charles Marx in 1912 and manufactured by a couple of different companies until the 1950s – mine was made in Jersey City. It’s a soundboard that has a group of 16 strings on the left that are arranged in four bass notes with triads for each note. And then on the right there are 15 pairs of strings running from low to high that are struck by hammers that bounce as you press them, in quite a hard-to-control way.I find it transporting and otherworldly… it’s a really mysterious, open-to-possibilities instrumentI love how the strings are arranged and that you can play it in different ways – sometimes I ignore the keys altogether and play it like a harp. I find it really transporting and otherworldly. If you’re a person who writes songs, sometimes sitting down with a guitar feels like you’re clicking into work mode. The Marxophone is different. I’ve never written anything on it. I find myself able to play and sing and just be transported.It reminds me of when I used to find and make instruments as a child. One time I found a metal shoe tree in our garage at home. I took it on to the drive and sat on a stool and started playing all these little bits of metal that had slightly different tones. Time disappeared: it was just me doing this thing and getting lost in it. That’s the moment I look for on stage – when, after three or four songs, you’re not concentrating on making the thing happen, it’s just happening. And that’s what I find I can really quickly get to with the Marxophone, because it’s just such a weirdo instrument.It didn’t take long to learn. Anyone can make a sound on it. Perhaps there are people who’ve mastered it – a Jimi Hendrix of the Marxophone – but I’m not aware of them. I like that it doesn’t feel competitive. It’s very tactile, you can get straight to it.I’ve put moments of it on songs – on Low Red Moon from The Love EP in 2011, for example. I wonder if I should use it more. But the thing that draws me to it is the unrepeatableness of it. So a thing that I might play on it today, I might not be able to remember tomorrow – or I might not feel like doing the same thing again, because it’s a really mysterious, open-to-possibilities instrument.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionI’ve never taken my Marxophone on stage. There’s always a first time I guess. But it’s not very easy to transport. I could just imagine opening the flight case and finding it all bashed up, with strings everywhere. It’s really fragile. And there’s an intimacy about it that I really like. What I do on it doesn’t have to be liked or approved of or even shared. I’d really hate to lose it. Killian FoxNilüfer Yanya on her Fender Stratocaster: ‘The way the guitar looks is very important to me’Nilüfer Yanya with her guitar. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverBorn in 1995 and raised in west London, Nilüfer Yanya put out three EPs before releasing her first album, Miss Universe, in 2019 to widespread acclaim – the Guardian called its “skewed alt-rock” the work of “a true original”. She followed it up in 2022 with Painless, a more cohesive and stripped-back record that featured on many best-of-year lists. Her latest single, Like I Say (I Runaway), is out now on Ninja Tune, and Yanya will play Rally festival in Southwark Park, London, on 24 AugustMy first instrument was piano. I started playing when I was six and put in a lot of effort, going up to grade eight, but for me the guitar was much cooler. I was into skater-punk bands like Blink-182 and I just really loved the idea of playing guitar. It fitted better with the ideas for songs that I had in my head.The first time I played, aged nine or 10, was with a random broken guitar that a family member gave to my sister. Later, I found a guitar on Gumtree and trekked across London to collect it. It cost around £60 and it was just terrible. The bag smelled like cat pee. Later I got a Japanese copy of a Burns that was a bit more reliable, but it still wasn’t very good.My playing improved at high school. I went to a very musical school called Pimlico [now Pimlico Academy] and my first guitar teacher was Dave Okumu, who studied at the same school and went on to form the Invisible. His classes were super-creative.I love playing guitar on stage. It makes sense and feels like an extension of yourselfWhen I was 16, I discovered the Pixies, and something about their guitar sound really appealed to me. A year later I bought Lianne La Havas’s first album. Her playing felt a lot more intricate, and I felt attached to that as well. Also it was nice to see a woman with a guitar – there weren’t many female guitar players in the bands I listened to, like the Strokes, the Cure or the Pixies.When I first started writing songs as a kid, I’d write the melodies and lyrics in a notebook. Then I started transferring the ideas to the guitar, and that helped me develop my own style. The physicality is nice: it makes the song you’re writing feel less abstract and more tangible. Even just holding a guitar, I’m thinking more intuitively about melodies, and everything feels a bit more natural.I love playing guitar on stage. I love that feeling when you’re just totally locked in, not even thinking about what you’re playing. It’s almost like simpler guitar parts carry the most weight. I mean, everyone loves a cool solo, but with my own playing I feel most attached to the instrument when there’s nothing remarkable happening. It just makes sense and it feels connected. The guitar feels like an extension of yourself.I remember playing my Strat at one of my first proper headline shows, at EartH in Hackney in 2019. I had been playing this guitar for years and I had a very honest, uncomplicated relationship with it. It was reliable and affordable – and pearly blue with a subtle sparkle which was very “me” at the time. I’d write, record and tour all on the same instrument – I don’t even remember thinking about any other guitars. The show at EartH is still one of my favourites – it was the first time I felt almost comfortable being on stage. But shortly after the gig I started playing a rose-gold Fender Jazzmaster, so my uninterrupted Strat era came to an end. I’d seen a few people playing Jazzmasters and I was eager to try something different. It felt good and natural to play.Of course, things can go wrong. At a show in Istanbul on our last big tour, I broke the strings on the final song and didn’t have any spares, so they ran around the venue and found this random, weird-looking guitar. I didn’t think I’d be able to finish the show, but actually it was really fun. When you’ve practised enough, and you’ve got enough adrenaline, everything’s fine.I’m not a guitar nerd. I wouldn’t trawl through guitar magazines for new technology. But the way the guitar looks is very important to me – most of the guitars I’ve owned have been blue. And the type of guitars I play has changed over the years. For the longest time, a Fender Strat was my guitar, then recently I started playing a Gibson SG, which has a different sound, a different energy – it’s associated with classic rock. But the Jazzmaster is probably the nicest guitar I’ve ever had. You’ve got to keep evolving. KF",

    "text": "Yvette Cooper has said she expects net migration to the Uk to fall “swiftly” under a Labour government, but refused to say by how much.The shadow home secretary told broadcasters on Sunday that it was clear net immigration must come down. She stopped short of setting a target, however, saying the Conservatives had failed when they had done so.Meanwhile, Keir Starmer made a renewed pitch for Conservative voters with a manifesto commitment to slash levels of immigration and ban law-breaking employers from hiring foreign workers.Plans outlined by the Labour leader in the Sun on Sunday could include laws to bar companies that break employment law – by failing to pay the minimum wage, for example – from hiring workers from overseas. New legislation would also link the immigration system to training, with businesses that apply for foreign worker visas having to train British people to do the jobs.Cooper told the BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “We’re not setting a target and the reason for that is partly because, to be honest, every time the Conservatives have done this, frankly, then they have just ended up being totally all over the place, ripping it up and discredited the whole system.“Also, because from one year to another, there are variations. So, for example, the pandemic means the net migration figures, of course, fell, but the homes for Ukraine visa rightly meant that the figures increased because of the war in Ukraine.”When pressed by Trevor Phillips on Sky News as to whether she believed UK residents could fill the thousands of vacancies in the adult social care sector and replace foreign workers, Cooper said there would continue to be a health and social care visa.“Immigration has always been important to this country, including for international talent and different areas, but it needs to be properly controlled,” she said.James Cleverly, the home secretary, responded to Labour’s plans by taking aim at its leader. “Keir Starmer has a track record of supporting high immigration levels and helping foreign criminals stay in Britain because he believes all immigration law is racist,” he said.“This is yet another day where Starmer will say what he thinks people want to hear during an election because he lacks conviction to say what he believes.”The Scottish National party, which held a campaign rally with more than 200 activists and candidates in Glasgow on Sunday afternoon, was critical of Labour’s pledge to cut net migration.The SNP leader, John Swinney, said Scottish businesses were struggling to fill vacancies, adding: “The biggest economic threat to Scotland is the current hostility towards migration that we have from the UK.”To applause, Swinney said Starmer’s rhetoric was “playing to a particular audience” that did not exist in Scotland”.The UK has experienced broadly similar levels of immigration as other high-income countries over the past few decades, according to the University of Oxford’s Migration Observatory. Net migration – a commonly used measure of the overall scale of migration – was “unusually high” in the 12 months up to the end of June 2023, the thinktank said in January.On illegal immigration, Cooper said Labour’s “initial assessments” suggested it would take a year to stop spending money on hotels to accommodate asylum seekers.While Labour has pledged to scrap the government’s Rwanda scheme, Cooper declined to rule out sending asylum seekers to another country to have their claims processed.“Keir has always said we would look at what works and there are different kinds of … offshore processing arrangements and things that have already been used at different times in the past,” she told the BBC.",

    "caption": "Growing awareness about ADHD and autism is reshaping thinking in science, social science and medicine. Scientists explain what’s behind the rise – and the best ways to improve neurodivergent lives",
    "text": "It was in the mid 90s that neurodiversity as a formal concept and a rights movement began to emerge. Aided by the internet, autistic people and those with other conditions were able to connect and began sharing their experiences: what they had in common, how their lives differed. A recurring theme was how many felt marginalised, pushed out of a society that embraced only typical ways of being in the world. The phrase “neurological diversity” cropped up in their discussions, which along with “neurodiversity” appeared in magazine articles later that decade.Neurodiversity has clear parallels with biodiversity. It champions difference and the validity of individuals. It holds that a vaguely defined majority can be described as neurotypical, with brains that operate in a broadly similar way. Others, meanwhile, are neurodivergent, with brains that are built and work somewhat differently.Neurodivergent people may be diagnosed with a range of conditions, and many co-occur in the same individual. There is no definitive list, but autism (and what was once known as Asperger’s syndrome) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common, as are dyslexia, a learning difficulty that affects reading and writing, and dyspraxia, which manifests as difficulties in movement and coordination.One of the most powerful things neurodiversity has done for neurodivergent people is give us a way of conceptualising ourselves as fundamentally worthyAs a concept and a movement, neurodiversity is reshaping thinking in science, social science and medicine. Neurodivergent people are more involved in the research and in the language used to describe them. Questions are being asked about research priorities, ethics, consent and whether studies will really benefit neurodivergent people.Interwoven with the concept of neurodiversity is an ongoing shift that embraces a social model of disability. It posits that many of the disabilities neurodivergent people experience are not caused by “something wrong” in the brain, but reflect the friction that arises when a neurodivergent person moves through a neurotypical world. The barriers they face, then, should be reduced, and if possible removed, by making society more accommodating.“There has absolutely been a change of ethos and tone,” says Professor Francesca Happé of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King’s College London. “We no longer talk about curing or treating autism, for example, but we do try and improve the things that go along with it, like anxiety and depression, bad sleep and epilepsy, intellectual disability and language impairment.”The concept of neurodiversity has been a powerful force at the individual level. Dr Monique Botha, who is autistic and a research fellow in psychology at the University of Stirling, interviewed autistic people for their PhD. One man recounted how some people chose not to vaccinate their children against particular infections for fear of them developing autism. The claim that vaccines drive autism has been vigorously demolished, but the man’s point was that some parents would rather risk their child catching a potentially lethal infection than be autistic.“It was a real moment of understanding the stigma attached to autism,” says Botha. “One of the most powerful things that neurodiversity has done for neurodivergent people is give us a way of conceptualising ourselves as fundamentally worthy, regardless of how disability is perceived by others.”About 15% of the global population are said to be neurodivergent. In the UK, at least 1% of people are thought to have an autistic spectrum condition and about 4% have ADHD. Dyslexia, dyspraxia and dyscalculia (difficulty in understanding numbers) sit at about 10%, 6% and 6% respectively. They are regarded as neurodevelopmental conditions: consequences of how the brain forms in the womb or early childhood, and many overlap.The official numbers weren’t always so high. Rewind the clock 40 years and doctors talked of four, perhaps six, in every 10,000 people being autistic. Today, records suggest 1-3% of the world’s population are autistic.Diagnoses of ADHD have similarly surged. Those affected tend to have difficulties focusing; they may act impulsively and struggle to sit still. In the UK, diagnoses in secondary school boys have more than doubled in two decades. In adults under 30 there has been a 20-fold rise. More people are being diagnosed for the first time in adulthood.In the US, the steady rise in autism diagnoses has been described as an “epidemic”, a word best reserved for infectious diseases, and which implies autism itself is rising. For many researchers that doesn’t ring true. The increase, they believe, is down to other factors such as changes in the way autism is defined.In the 1980s, doctors looked for a “pervasive lack of responsiveness” to others and “gross deficits” in language development. Now they cast a wider net, recording autism on seeing “persistent deficits” in areas such as social communication and interaction, alongside restricted, repetitive behaviours, such as lining up toys, insisting on the same daily schedule and having intense fixations.Sensory sensitivities feature too, as with ADHD. People can be hypersensitive to bright lights, particular sounds, smells, tastes or textures. Or they might be hyposensitive and seek out certain kinds of stimulation, or struggle to sense when they are hungry, ill or in pain.But shifts in definition are only one driver. There is a greater awareness of autism today, and doctors do a better job of spotting the condition where it was previously under-diagnosed. This is particularly evident in girls, adults and people of colour. “I think the majority of the rise is due to changes in diagnoses, understanding and awareness,” says Dr Cathy Manning, a psychologist at the University of Birmingham. “It is not necessarily that there are more autistic people than there were before, it’s that we’re now actually diagnosing them and reporting that they have those diagnoses.”There’s rarely an identifiable cause in a particular individual, but scientists suspect DNA underpins 80% of autism and ADHDPeople are missed for all manner of reasons. The stereotype of autism as a male condition (the diagnosis is four times more common in males than females) is one factor. Teachers might notice the boy who constantly walks the playground perimeter while the rest play football, but they overlook the girl who copies everything about a school friend in an effort to fit in. Such masking occurs in both sexes and is damaging in itself.“Autistic people tell us it’s exhausting and can erode your sense of self,” says Happé, “because you might make friends, but not feel like they are real friends, because they are friends with your mask rather than you.”Similar forces are at work in ADHD. In the late 90s, diagnosis required onset before seven years old and evidence of “impairment” in several settings. The age has now been pushed up to 12 and children need only show “symptoms” in some settings. Before 2013, ADHD and autism were officially mutually exclusive. If you had one, you could not be diagnosed with the other.One of the earliest descriptions of autism came in 1943, when Leo Kanner, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University hospital in Maryland, documented “infantile autism”. Kanner published notes on eight boys and three girls who all displayed what he called “autistic disturbances”. One, Donald Triplett, became known as the first person to receive an autism diagnosis. Seen by Kanner at the age of five, Triplett seemed to “live within himself”, learned endless pictures in an encyclopaedia, and delighted in spinning “anything he could seize upon”. Some of his responses were fascinating. Asked to subtract four from 10, Triplett said: “I’ll draw a hexagon.”Kanner didn’t know the causes. The children he assessed had “come into the world” with an “innate inability” to form the usual social connections, he noted. But he also mused on the significance that all appeared to come from “highly intelligent parents”, very few of whom he considered “really warm-hearted”. For the best part, Kanner added, the closest relatives were “persons strongly preoccupied with abstractions of scientific, literary or artistic nature” and “limited in genuine interest in people”. Three of the marriages he declared “dismal failures”.While Kanner had hit on autism’s developmental roots, his remarks about parents fuelled damaging assertions that it was caused by “refrigerator mothers”. It led some psychiatrists to recommend “parentectomy”, a word as brutal as it sounds, with children physically removed from their families.Claims that autism was due to parenting were knocked down in the 1970s. Susan Folstein and Michael Rutter at King’s College London recruited twins where one or both had autism. After interviewing the parents and assessing the children, they wrote one of the most important papers in the field, demonstrating for the first time that autism was largely genetic. Soon after, Lorna Wing and Judith Gould, also at King’s, described an “autism spectrum” after finding a large group of children who didn’t fit Kanner’s narrow definition but displayed repetitive behaviours and had difficulties with social interactions, communication and imagination.Physicians as far back as the 18th century described various disorders of attention, but today’s understanding of ADHD, which brings inattention and hyperactivity into one diagnosis, was not defined until the 1980s. Doctors look for a persistent pattern of behaviours present before the age of 12 which “interfere with functioning or development”, from having difficulty focusing and acting impulsively to struggling to remain seated when expected.Studies suggest that some areas of the brain are smaller in ADHD while others are larger; that people have an imbalance in neurotransmitters; and there is greater connectivity between frontal brain regions, which handle attention and control, and deeper structures linked to learning, movement, rewards and emotion.There’s rarely an identifiable cause of autism or ADHD in a particular individual. Researchers are investigating links between autism and having older parents, a problematic birth and infections in pregnancy. For ADHD, questions are being asked about lead exposure, drinking and smoking in pregnancy, premature birth and brain injury.Scientists suspect DNA underpins up to 80% of autism and ADHD. While some genetic variants involved are rare and contribute substantially, many more, possibly thousands, will be common and have individually minor effects. These are scattered through the population and come together to different extents in different people, ultimately leading to a diagnosis in some but not others.For many scientists, understanding the biology of autism, ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions means teasing apart the genetics. Autism studies have already highlighted genetic variants that affect neurons and how they communicate. But the research is moving slowly, in part because it can be controversial. Some fear the discovery of gene variants linked to autism will lead to embryo screening and prenatal tests that remove autistic people from society, similar to what happened with Down’s syndrome. Another fear is that doctors may one day seek to prevent, or “cure”, autism through gene editing. As the Autistic Self Advocacy Network stated in 2022: “we do not want “cures” for autism. We want to continue being autistic.”Genetic variants can affect neurons and how they communicate. Photograph: koto_feja/Getty ImagesMorgan James Morgan, a PhD student at the University of Surrey, studies the genetics of autism. He is autistic and has an autistic daughter. “I understand why people are concerned,” he says. “Those concerns are legitimate, but I’m not sure that should stop us doing this whole area of research when it’s clearly so important to understanding what’s going on.”Morgan says part of his research aims to understand why autism is so varied. “One autistic person can be extremely different from another,” he says. “You could just help people based on what they present with, but it must help to understand why one person is different from another, and it looks like a lot of that is genetically driven.”It’s not the only area of contention. Some worry that the social model of disability sidelines neurodivergent people who have clear medical needs. “There are groups of parents who feel very left behind because their children are so different from the people who are forerunners of the neurodiversity movement,” says Professor Patricia Howlin, a founding editor of the journal Autism. Up to 30% of autistic people are non-speaking. Some experience epileptic seizures. Others will be fed by a tube directly into their stomach.“It goes back to the spectrum idea,” says Howlin. “There are autistic people who may be brilliant scientists or artists at one end of the spectrum, and at the other end there are autistic people who need help with almost all their daily activities. There are people who are highly sensitised to anything that suggests you might intervene or treat, whereas others, especially families or carers, say we desperately need intervention and treatment.”Proper support in education is essential, Happé says. If a teacher doesn’t know a child is autistic, the child might come across as rude when they are just being “autistically direct”. Clear information about changes in activities helps, as do visual schedules, timers that ensure transitions aren’t as jarring, and knowing children’s sensitivities. “Most of the things that work for autistic children are good for all children,” Happé adds.Improving the environment is key for ADHD too, says Dr Max Davie, a consultant paediatrician in London who has an ADHD diagnosis and is a trustee of ADHD UK. He uses the analogy of a “hungry brain” that is chronically under-stimulated. People need to understand ADHD and know how to respond to it, he says. Building positive relationships is crucial: if a child is crashing around the house, threatening to take away their Xbox could be counter-productive, pushing the relationship on to a confrontational footing. Good brain health is important too, he adds. “Make sure you are sleeping well, that your mood is under control, and get plenty of exercise. It makes your brain healthy and you’ll be better able to cope with your ADHD.”Autism and ADHD are separate conditions but there is an overlap in the underlying biology, who is diagnosed, the behaviours that manifest, and the care and support that works.

    "text": "A new ministerial direction on deporting foreign-born criminals will prioritise “community safety” over their ties to Australia, federal cabinet minister Murray Watt has said as he denied the government made a mistake with the controversial “direction 99”.But mystery still surrounds the government’s purported use of drones to monitor people released from immigration detention, with no confirmation of which agency is operating them.Watt, the minister for emergency management and agriculture, told the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday that the new immigration rule would focus more on community safety, after the administrative appeals tribunal had pointed to ministerial direction 99 in overturning visa cancellations and allowing foreign-born criminals to remain in Australia.Direction 99 had obliged government officials and courts to consider a person’s ties to Australia among other factors in deciding whether to cancel a visa. The government last week confirmed a new direction would be issued.“What we’re doing now is making it absolutely crystal-clear for the AAT and departmental officials interpreting it that community safety is to be the number one priority, more than anything else,” Watt said.Under direction 99 the strength, nature and duration of ties to Australia are considered alongside four other “primary considerations”: protecting the community, “whether the conduct engaged in constituted family violence”, the interests of children and expectations of the Australian community.Albanese announces reversal of ministerial ruling that saw criminals given visas – videoWatt said the AAT had interpreted direction 99 in a way the government hadn’t intended, with a person’s ties to Australia being considered too highly. He said the government didn’t mean “for community safety to be relegated below that as a priority”.“What would have been a mistake is if the government had said that we want to put duration of stay above community safety and we didn’t do that,” he said.The new direction is yet to be shared publicly. Government sources said it was likely to be finalised in coming days. It will be issued by the minister, and not require legislative change.Watt also hit back at criticisms from the Coalition, claiming visa cancellation rates were lower since Labor had come to office, and that Labor had “deported more criminals in our first year in office than the government ever did under Peter Dutton’s reign”.Watt confirmed again the government was using drones to monitor immigration detainees released under the NZYQ high court verdict. There had been confusion last week after immigration minister Andrew Giles said drones were being used in the government’s response “to keep track of people”. SBS reported on Friday that many police services and security agencies had either said they weren’t operating the drones, or declined to comment.Watt said the drones were being used “in an operational sense”.“My understanding is that drones are being used as part of this operation, but more in the sense of monitoring the accommodation people are living in, for example, ensuring that it’s not too close to schools or other areas that they’re not supposed to be living close to,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This imagery can also assist identify facilities in proximity of the accommodation that may be relevant to an individual’s visa conditions,” the spokesperson said.Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, shadow home affairs minister James Paterson questioned the use of drones.“You don’t need a drone to do that. That sounds like satellite imagery. It sounds like, frankly, something a 12-year-old would get on Google Earth.“Either Andrew Giles accidentally and casually disclosed a previously secret drone surveillance program operating domestically in Australia … Or he made it up and it’s not actually happening at all,” he said.An Australian Border Force spokesperson last week said it does not comment on “the specifics of its operational capability or that of its law enforcement partners” but that federal authorities were “working closely with state and territory authorities and law enforcement to ensure community safety”.“The use of surveillance technology by law enforcement agencies is governed by strict legislative requirements,” the ABF said.",

    "text": "On the day I received an offer from my first-choice university, I expected to feel elation and excitement. I had spent years preparing for this moment, and yet when it came, I felt only dread at the thought of freshers’ week and all the social challenges this would inevitably involve.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.I had always been something of a shrinking violet and the fact that I now had a close group of friends at school did not helped to assuagemy social anxiety. I assumed this was a stroke of extreme good luck – a one-off. The potential for rejection seemed immense, and I feared I would spend the next few years in loneliness.I was wrong: I soon made new friends. Yet my shyness lingered as I embarked on my career in journalism – a bizarre choice, I admit, for someone who felt nervous meeting strangers and loathed the idea of networking. I found ways to deal with those challenges, but it was only within the past few years that I began to truly relish the chance to meet new people.If only I had known then what I know now, my path might have been so much easier. As a science writer, I’ve witnessed a wealth of new research that has identified the psychological barriers that prevent us from building better relationships. Fortunately, my deep dive into the academic literature has also identified practical ways to build social confidence.I would turn down party invitations from people I admired, on the assumption they had only asked me out of politeness.Consider a phenomenon known as the liking gap, which describes our tendency to underestimate how much others have enjoyed our company and wish to build a stronger connection with us.In a series of experiments, psychologists asked two strangers to meet and chat and then questioned each party about their expectations and perceptions of the conversation. Before speaking, both assumed that the exchange would feel uncomfortable – yet they ended up enjoying it far more than they had believed they would. Over countless trials in all kinds of contexts, most people found it far easier to talk to strangers than they had initially feared.If only that pleasure was combined with self-confidence. After a conversation, most people assume they liked the other person more than the other person liked them. Or framed another way: neither party realise quite how appealing they have been and they don’t have faith the other person would be interested in building on that rapport with a future friendship.The liking gap can linger for months. One study asked university roommates to report on their perceptions of each other during their first year of living together. On average, it took each student about nine months for them to overcome their self-doubt and correctly appreciate how much the other person liked them.When I first learned about this research, I couldn’t help but cringe at all the times I had been afflicted by the liking gap. After meeting charming, funny and kind people, whom I wanted to get to know better, I would doubt that this was reciprocated. As a result, I would avoid any further contact for fear that I might seem embarrassingly needy. I would even turn down party invitations from people who I genuinely appreciated and admired, on the assumption they had only asked me out of politeness.Digging into the scientific literature, I soon found examples of many other misplaced fears that stand in the way of deeper and more meaningful relationships. Many of us are too shy about giving compliments or expressing our gratitude for other’s actions, for instance. We assume that they already know how great they are and we doubt our abilities to express those compliments elegantly. We imagine our gestures will seem ham-fisted and gauche.Those worries are largely unjustified. Most people are perfectly capable of distinguishing genuine praise from flattery and we consistently underestimate how much joy our words will bring. Provided that we display sensitivity and common sense, then our genuine appreciation will be welcomed for what it is – a small act of kindness.Expressing appreciation of others not only brings joy to the person receiving the praise but also to the person saying it; most people feel much better for having spoken their warm feelings. Unfortunately, our natural reserve means that most of us miss out on these opportunities to cement our bonds.We have similarly misplaced intuitions about self-disclosure – we tend to hold back our intimate thoughts and feelings and instead engage in superficial small talk when people tend to be far more interested in our inner life than we’d expect. This is a shame since that knowledge would be the foundation for a deeper relationship. And when we need help, we believe that people will resent us for our requests, when scientific research shows that they can enhance closeness, by proving our regard for the other person.Whether we regularly feel lonely, fear walking into a party full of strangers, or wish to get along better with our colleagues, most of us could do with a bit more faith in our social skills.Based on my own experiences and the research I have read, I believe this is imperative for anyone who wishes to live well. Feeling socially connected not only brings great joy, it also soothes our stress responses, thereby reducing our risk of many different illnesses – from the common cold to cardiac arrest. The results from more than 100 studies all show that social connection is as important for our health as diet or exercise. Greater connection can also enhance our creativity. The more nodes we have in our social network, the more exposed we will be to fresh ideas and new sources of inspiration.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionI have found that simply learning about concepts such as the liking gap can help us conquer our shyness, but it also needs perseverance if the effects are to last. As you will have found when learning any skill, greater confidence comes with regular practice outside our usual comfort zones.As my fluency in Italian increased, I was touched to see how my conversation partners saved me from embarrassment For me, an ambition to speak Italian gave me the necessary push. As my fluency in the language increased, I started arranging “conversation exchanges” with native speakers who wished to practise their English. Needless to say, I made many blunders, but I was touched to see how sensitively my conversation partners saved me from embarrassment and how easy it was to build a friendship despite the language barrier. Striking up new conversations in my native language suddenly felt a lot less daunting.You don’t need to go to this extreme. One study took the form of a week-long “scavenger hunt” that encouraged participants to set daily goals to approach and talk to strangers. They could decide to find someone with interesting shoes or eye-catching hair and then chat with them for a few minutes. Day by day, the participants came to recognise the pleasures of being more sociable and were less anxious about the possibility of rejection.We may still need strategies to help offset self-doubt when it kicks in. One tool that I use is “defocusing”, which involves making a conscious effort to look at the big picture instead of getting hung up on small details. If we think we have made a faux pas, we can remind ourselves of the many other things that we exchanged during the conversation; the other person’s impression of us is unlikely to hinge on a single clumsy comment, which will probably be forgotten. We might also remind ourselves of previous instances in which we’ve instantly jumped to the worst conclusion, but later found our fears were not proven.One of the best things you can do to overcome your shyness is to treat yourself with greater compassion. Many of us believe that self-criticism is essential if we are to behave better in the future, but the scientific literature suggests the very opposite is true. Beating ourselves up over a potential embarrassment only adds to our stress and reduces our capacity to learn from the perceived mistake. A simple exercise is to imagine that you are encouraging a friend or family member who is facing the same challenge or feeling the same worries; you might even write it down in the form as a letter. Once you have expressed those sentiments, you may find it far easier to be kinder to yourself.At the height of my shyness, it would have seemed inconceivable that I would write a book about social connection – let alone support it with public talks and media interviews. I don’t regret those years of anxiety; when considering the past, my overwhelming emotion is one of gratitude to all the people who proved my fears of rejection to be false. But I do wish that I could go back in time and tell my 18-year-old self about what I had learned.

    "text": "Mindfulness, spirituality, wellbeing – these words are treated as interchangeable in the global wellness marketplace. But spirituality is not the same as being happy. Spirituality, according to almost of the world’s great wisdom traditions, requires work, service and sacrifice.The world’s dominant religions – Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam – all encourage practices such as yoga, mindfulness meditation, chanting, prayer, group singing and dancing. These have long been effective tools in giving followers an experience of deep connection, sometimes accompanied by sensations of awe, ecstasy and transcendence – feelings that encourage them to return.But a sense of joy or connectedness is not an end in itself. These feelings are the emotional motivators of ethical action. Every religion sets out rules for right conduct – consider Buddhism’s eight-fold path, Judaism’s 10 commandments, or Vedic Hinduism’s restraints and observances. Indigenous traditions go beyond these religions, including humans and non-humans (or “more-than-humans”, as the Potawatomi botanist and writer Robin Wall Kimmerer describes our partners in the natural world) in the circle of those to whom we owe service.Yet today’s global wellness industry would have us think that spirituality is just another dimension of feeling good. The Buddhist practitioner Miles Neale coined the term “McMindfulness” to describe the western tendency to extract practices from ancient religious traditions and turn them into “colourfully packaged bite-size morsels for … mass consumption”. The US$1.5tn wellness market seeks to sell the health benefits of spirituality, divorced from the ethical frameworks within which these practices developed.Religious ethical frameworks are hugely damaging when they are used to support power inequities in the realms of gender, class, race and sexual identity. But the use of spiritual practices, in the absence of any ethical requirements, can also be damaging. For example, scientific studies have shown that yoga and meditation can actually increase people’s sense of “spiritual superiority” and focus on the self rather than quieting the ego and encouraging charitable acts of service.Evangelical Christian megachurches have grown, well, “mega” through their use of age-old practices such as group singing, music and pageantry. They create experiences of “collective effervescence”, as identified by the sociologist Emile Durkheim back in 1912 as the foundation of religion. An age-old problem arises when churches connect such spiritual emotions not to ethical action but to intolerance, selfishness or greed.As far back as the 14th century, Christianity was taking advantage of people’s spiritual feelings for money-making ends, selling “indulgences” for the benefit of souls in purgatory (God’s hypothetical waiting room). Martin Luther opposed this practice as detracting from people’s ability to give to the poor. In one of religious history’s great ironies, Luther’s theology of a personal connection to God would eventually provide the foundation for the prosperity gospel of some of today’s megachurches.Living a spiritual life is not about adhering rigidly to a church dogma. Nor is it about engaging in practices such as meditation in the absence of a larger context. Indeed, yoga means “yoke” and the type of yoga popular in the west is just one way unite oneself with a greater consciousness, something bigger than oneself. Other yogas of the Hindu tradition include work, philosophy, learning and acts of service.I don’t want to be “McMindful”. I don’t want to extract practices from religious traditions to commoditise them and make myself feel good about myself. Well, I probably do want to feel good about myself. But wellbeing practices start and end there, whereas spiritual practices are supposed to extend myself beyond my “self”, encouraging me to contribute to the wellness of all beings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Five Great ReadsEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

If I am going to spend 20 minutes a day sitting on my butt cultivating compassion to others, I am also going to get up and act on that sensation, making donations, volunteering or just being nice to someone I don’t really like. If I am going to sing about how God/dess loves us all every Sunday, I am also going to take that love and turn it into charitable, non-judgmental acts of kindness every other day of the week.I can meditate and do yoga (actually I kind of suck at yoga) or raise my hands in group worship. But I cannot treat these activities and the feelings they create as ends in themselves. These practices are tools to help me stay focused, cultivating the attitudes and emotions that sustain me as I attempt to live an ethical life.

    "text": "All week in parliament, Anthony Albanese and Andrew Giles have expressed frustration that in overturning visa cancellations affecting foreign-citizen convicted criminals, the administrative appeals tribunal (AAT) did not apply enough “common sense”.With further comments from their cabinet colleague Murray Watt on ABC’s Insiders on Sunday, it is finally clear what they mean. The clue is in the use of numbers and letters.In listing “primary considerations” for the home affairs department and the AAT to weigh up in making these decisions, the executive government intended them to be ranked in descending order.The department (and presumably the AAT) didn’t automatically do that because that’s not what its written direction expressly says.This is about the wording in ministerial direction 99, the guide used by the minister’s departmental delegates in the first instance to decide if there are good reasons to overturn a convicted criminal’s visa cancellation. Where the delegates decide the cancellation should proceed, the same direction is then used by members of the AAT who adjudicate on appeals to those decisions.Section 501 of the Migration Act triggers the cancellation process when a visa holder is convicted of an offence punishable by 12 months or more in jail.But the law also provides some wriggle room, in the form of a ministerial direction setting out issues to be considered in deciding if the person should indeed be deported or can stay.Albanese announces reversal of ministerial ruling that saw criminals given visas – videoMinisterial direction 99 lists five “primary considerations”. Issued in January last year, it updated the Morrison government’s version, direction 90, which had four.Those were: the protection of the community; whether the offending conduct involved family violence; the best interests of minor children in the person’s family; and community expectations.These conditions were numbered one to four in that order.At the instruction of Albanese, the immigration minister amended that – creating direction 99 – to add one further consideration: the “strength, nature and duration” of the person’s ties to Australia.He slotted it in at number three.The numbering and the fact that it was dropped into the middle of the list, not just added on at the end, indicate these considerations were meant to be weighted in that order. It suggests the government thought it more important than the two below it.That seems to be what the government intended. But it simply assumed that’s how it would be read – the order does not spell it out.Instead, it says only that “one or more primary considerations may outweigh other primary considerations”. In other words, the deciders can weigh them up against one another and decide their relative importance. It doesn’t say that number one is meant to be number one.But Watt’s comments on Sunday suggest that’s what the government intended.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was always our intention that community safety would be a primary consideration.”What he means is that it was intended to be the primary consideration of the primary considerations. First among equals. Number one.But Guardian Australia understands decision-makers viewed them as being equal because nothing expressly ranked them in priority order. The direction was not clear on this point.Possibly supporting the suggestion that the government thought they would be seen as being ranked in order, the “other considerations” are listed differently.These are not numbered. They are listed by bracketed letters – a, b, c, etc – suggesting they’re a bunch of equal also-ran factors.On that list are: any legal consequences of the decision; the extent of impediments if the person is removed; the impact on victims; and the impact on Australian business interests.The existing direction 99, which runs to 24 pages, also lays out detailed principles the decision-makers should follow in weighing the considerations.“In some circumstances, the nature of the non-citizen’s conduct, or the harm that would be caused if the conduct were to be repeated, may be so serious that even strong countervailing considerations may be insufficient to justify not cancelling or refusing the visa, or revoking a mandatory cancellation,” the last listed principle says.To explain further, it suggests, for example, that in a case involving family violence where there is no evidence that the person poses a further risk, the community’s expectations on such matters may nevertheless need to prevail. This suggests that even if the listed factors are meant to be weighted by their numbered order, sometimes if number two and number five align, they may outweigh number one.Common sense is not mentioned. The government assumed it was implied.Giles and Albanese have now indicated the soon-to-be revised version of ministerial direction 99 will put a premium on community protection. Giles has said it will also deal with “some additional concerns that we see around victims and their families”.Expect, at the very least, a line to be added saying the primary considerations should be weighted by their numbered order, which already has community protection first, if not placing it more expressly on its own. And the particular “other” consideration mentioning victims may now be either elevated to the first list or expressly emphasised within the second.Sometimes, even common sense requires clearer direction.",
