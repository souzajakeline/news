A police dog and acoustic devices were used to search for survivors.Complications included a gas leak, safety concerns about how much work could happen at the site and fire underneath the rubble in the collapsed area.Drone footage shows Sydney home in ruins after Whalan explosion – videoCrews earlier rescued a woman in her 60s and a woman in her 70s from the ruins, and later saved a small dog that was unharmed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A closing 68 gave the 22-year-old a winning total of four under par, three shots clear of her compatriot Hinako Shibuno.They were the only two players to finish under par as Andrea Lee struggled to a closing 75 to share third place with her fellow American Ally Ewing on level par, Ewing surging through the field with a 66.Meechai fared even worse with a closing 77 and Minjee Lee limped home in 41 for a final round of 78. Saso is the third player in history after Pak Se-ri and Chun In-gee to make major championships their first two LPGA Tour titles.“It feels great,” Saso said. “Winning in 2021 I represented the Philippines. I feel like I was able to give back to my mom. This year I was able to represent Japan, and I think I was able to give back to my dad. I’m very happy that I was able to do it.“It’s just a wonderful feeling that I was able to give back to my parents in the same way. Since 2021 I haven’t won. I think it just makes it special after a long wait and I wasn’t expecting to win the US Women’s Open, the same as last time.“I think I really wanted it, as well. Not just to get a second win but also to prove something to myself. I haven’t won in two and a half or three years. I definitely had a little doubt if I can win again or if I won’t win again. But I was able to prove a little bit something to myself.”Elsewhere, Scotland’s Robert MacIntyre recovered from a shaky start and held off a host of challengers to win his first PGA Tour title in the RBC Canadian Open. MacIntyre shot a final round of 68 at Hamilton Golf and Country Club to finish 16 under par, a shot ahead of the home favourite Ben Griffin.Griffin had piled on the pressure with birdies on the 15th, 16th and 17th to close within one of his playing partner, but could not find a fourth in a row on the last to potentially force a playoff. That meant MacIntyre had the luxury of two-putting from 10 feet for the win before embracing his father Dougie, who had been called on to caddie at short notice.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionAsked why he was so emotional at the win, MacIntyre gestured to his dad as he told CBS: “Because of this. I’m speechless to be honest. This is just everything for me and my family, my girlfriend, my team. I can’t believe I’ve done it with him on the bag. I’m crying with joy but I’m laughing because I didn’t think it was possible.”MacIntyre had seen his four-shot overnight lead wiped out in the space of four holes after he bogeyed the first and Mackenzie Hughes made a hat-trick of early birdies.However, MacIntyre responded superbly to birdie the fourth, seventh and eighth to regain control of the £7.4m event, despite having to ask for a drone being used for the television coverage to be moved on several occasions before he finally got his wish.Another birdie on the 11th was followed by a wild tee shot on the 12th into a water hazard and another bogey on the 13th opened the door for the chasing pack, but the Ryder Cup star crucially birdied the 15th and safely parred the last three holes."}

One of a different kind of seeding and growth, and of a sport that has literally made the earth move, across two continents and 11,000 miles, to make this event happen.When the opening batter takes guard in New York on Monday as Sri Lanka play South Africa in the first competitive game at the venue, he will be standing on a drop-in pitch that started its life more then eight months ago in the South Australia city of Adelaide.From there it travelled via the port of Savannah, Georgia to Boynton Beach in Florida, where the grass was sown and nurtured. At the end of April it was lifted back on to a lorry for the 1,000-mile journey to the new, temporary Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, where it and three others slotted seamlessly into the holes created for them.“Since then we’ve just allowed it to grow in, given it time to adjust to the natural conditions it’s facing,” says Damian Hough, who has overseen the project. “Given it time to acclimatise. It’s a living and breathing thing and it’s gone through quite a stressful process. It’s no different to humans, really: there’s a stress period and you need to give it time to adjust and recover.”Hough is head curator – ie groundsman – at Adelaide Oval, where drop-in pitches have been used since 2013, giving him precisely the expertise the International Cricket Council was looking for when it embarked on this project. The alternative – using the ground in Long Island’s Eisenhower Park, where the stadium has been constructed – was never feasible.“It’s just parkland. It wasn’t fit for world-class international cricket,” Hough says. “The space was flat but it was a natural field, with a loam instead of a sandy profile. To get it to an international cricket standard they needed to add drainage and a sand profile and irrigation and a new variety of turf on top. It’s amazing how quickly they were able to pull it off, among the challenges that the weather has thrown at them.”The temporary stands of the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium. Photograph: Bruce Bennett/Getty ImagesThe “they” Hough is referring to is LandTek, a local company specialising in sports facilities, with which he was paired by the ICC. The steel trays that the pitch has grown and been transported in were made in Adelaide but by the time they were filled they were in Florida, and his usual materials were unavailable. So he was forced to turn to the unfamiliar: soil designed for use in baseball mounds, a variety of Bermuda grass known as Tahoma 31 for the pitches, and Kentucky Bluegrass for the outfield. Hough had never used these things before. Then he had to wait and hope.“You have checkpoints at certain times where you measure, say, the root depth, and you know what you’re trying to get,” he says. “We’ve exceeded it every step of the way. Our root depth is a lot deeper than what we could do back home, we haven’t been able to drive root growth the way they do over here.“It’s the climate in Florida – it’s an unbelievable part of the world to grow grass. So everything along the way has just been: ‘Jeez, that’s gone well.’ Hopefully that correlates into really good cricket and really good pitches. There’ve been challenges, curveballs thrown along the way that you have to adjust to. But that’s just life as a curator.”skip past newsletter promotionSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All four will have multiple outings as New York hosts a run of eight games in 10 days, but one is being saved for the biggest match of the opening group stage, India and Pakistan next Sunday.“We’ve earmarked which one that’ll be. We know our rotations, what games are going to be played on what pitches,” Hough says. “But to me all of the pitches are equal.”All that remains is to watch the first ball go down and see how the pitches play. “As we get close to the tournament I’ve constantly got a little bit of anxiety there, because it’s something we’ve never done,” Hough says. “You know you’ve thought through the processes, you know you’re happy with the way it’s come together. So theoretically, it should play well.“But at the same time, until you have those games you’re not sure because the pitch is only five months old – it’s a short period of time to build a cricket pitch and play on it. As long as they’re consistent, as long as the outfield plays well and it’s not too slow, that’s what we’re after. But until you use it the first time there’s always a sense of: ‘OK, how’s this going to go?’”"}
{"title": "Child sex abuse is all around us - and online it can start with legal porn | Sonia Sodha | The Guardian", "caption": "Men not originally sexually attracted to children sometimes seek more extreme content, research shows", "author": "Sonia Sodha", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/02/child-sex-abuse-is-all-around-us-and-online-it-can-start-with-legal-porn", "text": "Think of a man viewing images or footage of child sexual abuse online, and what comes to mind? I’d bet that for most of us this horrible thought experiment conjures up a Jimmy Savile-style monster sitting in front of the computer screen. But new research from the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, a child sexual abuse prevention charity, highlights how this paradigm does not by itself account for the scale of online offending. Cling to it too hard and it could hamper our ability to prevent the abuse of children.Because child sexual abuse is such a horrific and unthinkable crime, we tend to “other” the men who do it. They won’t be men in our families, workplaces and communities, but evil individuals in other people’s lives. This is comforting for us adults, but the complacency it engenders puts children at risk. It turns child sexual abuse into something that happens to other people’s children, not those you love, and if it were happening, of course you’d know because you would be able to spot it.The figures tell something different: child sexual abuse is depressingly common, with at least 15% of girls and 5% of boys experiencing it before the age of 16, and abuse within the family is one of the more common types reported to police. The sad truth is that many of us will unwittingly know men who have sexually abused children.Another misperception is that child sexual abuse is driven primarily by the perverted sexual attraction some men feel towards pre-pubescent children. That accounts for some offending, but it is far from the whole story: child sexual abuse, like other sex crimes, can be more about risk, power and control; and it is also very much a crime of opportunity. If there is more opportunity to offend, more child sexual abuse will happen.There is perhaps no place that offers greater opportunities to engage with child sexual abuse than the internet, whether through viewing images of child sexual abuse, or creating them by grooming and exploiting children online. This type of offending is growing: in 2022, the police arrested 850 people a month for online sexual offending. These figures are the tip of the iceberg. The National Crime Agency estimates that up to 850,000 people pose a sexual threat to children online and offline.The Lucy Faithfull Foundation (which receives charitable funding from the Indigo Trust, of which I am a trustee) runs various interventions, including a helpline, for men who have offended or who are at risk of offending, as part of its work to prevent child sexual abuse. It published a paper last week, based on its clinical work, that highlights that most people accessing the helpline reported problematic use of legal pornographyViewing pornography does not mean someone will necessarily escalate to illegal sexual images but, for the men the foundation worked with, “adult pornography often serves as a gateway to viewing sexual images of children”.The theory about how one leads to the other is thought to be because some people become desensitised in their response to pornographic stimulus. Porn has never been more easily available: it is the subject of one in four internet searches, and the four largest pornography sites received a combined 11bn visits a month in 2020.Porn platforms make more profit the more they keep individuals engaged. Exploitation and abuse of women is rife in the industry – both in the production side and also in the way it depicts sex. There is a vast amount of violent and coercive content that features women reacting positively or neutrally towards aggression.Some people report needing to consume increasingly novel – and in some cases, extreme – forms of pornography in order to get the same “hit” as from when they first started watching porn. The online world makes that entirely possible. So some men who have ended up viewing sexual images of children may not have originally been sexually attracted to children, according to the Lucy Faithfull Foundation.Another charity, the Centre of Expertise on Child Sexual Abuse, highlights that the most striking feature of men who view but do not produce sexual images of children is their “ordinariness” compared with those convicted of contact child sexual abuse.This makes for uncomfortable reading because it challenges our preconceptions about the men who view child sexual abuse online.But it is so important in understanding how to prevent online abuse. There is more to be done by relentlessly targeting and taking down illegal online content, but also intervening and disrupting men at risk of veering towards viewing child sexual abuse imagery could help stop the appalling abuse of children involved in production and sharing of this content. The Lucy Faithfull Foundation piloted a chatbot on PornHub that popped up if someone tried to search for unlawful content involving children. It directed them to support services to stop their behaviour and during the 18 months it was in operation the number of searches fell.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionRightly, there has been a broader debate about the impacts of porn in light of evidence suggesting that exposure to violent pornography is associated with attitudes supporting violence towards women in men, and that early exposure to pornography is linked to harmful sexual behaviours in children and young people, including sexual abuse perpetrated by young people towards their peers.There is still a huge amount we don’t know but, as with other potentially harmful behaviour, it is likely to be riskier for some individuals than others.The emerging evidence that, for some men, an unhealthy relationship with pornography may be the first step to engaging with online imagery of child sexual abuse is a reminder that the conversation about porn cannot stop at how to safeguard children and young people, as critical as that is. We also need a better understanding of the long-term harm pornography can have on adults, and how they might be able to protect themselves. Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist"}

Rob inspired the entire country with his brave battle against motor ­neurone disease since his diagnosis.“He passed away peacefully at Pinderfields Hospital near his home surrounded by his loving family after becoming ill earlier this week. On behalf of the Burrow family, we would like to thank the staff for their compassion and caring for Rob in his final days.”The Burrow family added in their own statement: “The outpouring of love and support that Rob and the whole Burrow family have received over the last four and a half years meant so much to Rob. In particular, the rugby league family and the MND community have rallied around Rob to inspire him, thank you for your support.“For those who knew Rob throughout his life, his determination and spirit in the face of MND over the last four and a half years came as no surprise. Rob never accepted that he couldn’t do something, he just found his own way of doing it better than anyone else. He will continue to inspire us all every day. In a world full of adversity, we must dare to dream.”Alongside his close friend and former teammate Kevin Sinfield, the pair raised the condition in the national consciousness. After his diagnosis, Burrow and his ­family raised awareness plus millions of pounds for the MND community, including the foundation of the Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon in 2023.That significant fundraising also included £6m to build the Rob ­Burrow Centre for MND in Leeds, to help ­support people living with the ­disease. The breaking of the ground on that facility was due to take place on Monday and his former club confirmed, as per Burrow’s wishes, that will still go ahead as planned.After making his debut for Leeds in 2001, Burrow went on to become one of the most important players in the club’s history. A member of the Rhinos’ golden generation, he was instrumental in helping Leeds end their 32-year wait for a league championship with victory in the 2004 Super League Grand Final.He went on to win eight Super League titles, perhaps the most ­notable of which was in 2011 against St Helens when he scored what is still regarded as the greatest try in Grand Final history. He also helped Leeds win the treble in 2015 and in 2017, in his final match as a player, he helped the Rhinos defeat Castleford in the league showpiece at Old Trafford.Rob Burrow hoists aloft the Super League trophy after Leeds win the 2015 Grand Final – he won eight league titles with the club in all. Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesBurrow made 492 appearances for Leeds, placing him fifth in the club’s all-time appearance list. He was capped five times by Great ­Britain, 15 by England and won the ­Challenge Cup in 2014 and 2015, as well as the World Club Challenge on three ­occasions. He remains one of the modern era’s most decorated players.The Prince of Wales, who ­presented CBEs to Burrow and ­Sinfield in January, saluted “a legend of rugby league” on social media, adding: “Rob Burrow had a huge heart. He taught us ‘in a world full of adversity, we must dare to dream’. Catherine and I send our love to Lindsey, ­Jackson, Maya and Macy.”Leeds opened the doors to Headingley Stadium on Sunday evening, the venue where Burrow made his name in Super League, shortly after news of his death emerged to allow the public to pay their respects to one of rugby league’s greats.Burrow former Rhinos teammate Barrie McDermott, who has also played a part in fundraising for the MND community, said on X, formerly known as Twitter: “The world will never forget Rob Burrow. He is a hero to so many people and an inspiration to all who were lucky enough to meet him or came across his story on and off the pitch.“He was brave beyond words in those last few months, he has taught me so much about courage, kindness and love. Good night God bless my little brother I feel blessed to call you my friend.”The Motor Neurone Disease ­Association, for whom Burrow was a patron, said: “It is testament to the strength of feeling people have for Rob that the support in his name has never wavered.“The MND Association is incredibly ­grateful to Rob and his family for helping to raise awareness of MND, and funds for the Association, by sharing the details of their journey and by inspiring so many people both within the MND community and the wider public.”In a 2021 interview with the Guardian, Burrow said: “I’ve had such a wonderful life. I want to make the most of the time I have left.”"}

With certain third-round matches to be finished, the French Open organisers opted to move the uncompleted contest between Zizou Bergs and Grigor Dimitrov to Court Philippe-Chatrier before Novak Djokovic’s night session match, which was scheduled to begin at 8.15pm. Unless every match finished in straight sets, it was obvious that chaos would follow.It is fair to say that those matches did not finish efficiently. The match on court, Alexander Zverev v Tallon Griekspoor, immediately descended into a dramatic five-set battle. Then Bergs forced a fourth set. Djokovic and Lorenzo Musetti entered the court at about 10.30pm, with Djokovic closing off his excellent five-set comeback victory at 3.07am, the latest finish in the history of the French Open.No other prominent sport in the world has its athletes competing in the early hours of the morning, yet tennis has managed to make it a regular occurrence. In recent years, matches have finished as late as 4.05am at the Australian Open with Andy Murray last year and 4.55am at the Mexican Open in 2022.“I think it’s really unhealthy,” Ons Jabeur, the world No 9, said. “I hope Novak is recovering really well for the next one. But yeah, we are trying to push to have better scheduling. But, you know, when you have long matches sometimes you don’t know. Obviously with the prime matches it is also more difficult. I feel like 8.15 is really late to start the match.”At about 1am, Casper Ruud closed off his four-set win over Tomás Martín Etcheverry before addressing the Court Suzanne-Lenglen crowd with a smile: “I love tennis and I love Roland Garros,” he said. “But I’m not sure if I love playing at 1am.” Ruud was still going through his post-match routine and talking about it on X as Djokovic’s match came to an end. For the players, the work does not stop as they leave the court.“I feel like a lot of times people think you’re done, but really, 3am, then you have press and then you have to shower, eat and then a lot of times people do treatments, so that’s probably not going to bed until 5am at the earliest, maybe 6am, and even 7am,” Coco Gauff said. “I definitely think it’s not healthy. It may not be fair for those who have to play late because it does ruin your schedule.”Casper Ruud’s match also stretched into Sunday. ‘I love tennis but I’m not sure I love playing at 1am,’ he said. Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile the French Open used to receive criticism for its early finishes with no floodlights, nights at Roland Garros have now swung to completely different extremes since the roof was inaugurated on Philippe-Chatrier in 2021. In some ways, things are even worse.With the arrival of the roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier and floodlights around the grounds, the French Open initiated its controversial night session, selling the rights of one prime-time match per day to Prime Video for a hefty fee as the tournament searched for new sources of income to transform the grounds. The tournament had previously been carried entirely by France Télévisions, the free-to-air national broadcaster.Despite how the night contests have been billed as the feature match each day – and the French Tennis Federation has received significant criticism for not scheduling a single women’s match in the night session so far this year – it often seems that players are in a race to avoid receiving the graveyard slot. Both Rafael Nadal and Iga Swiatek have repeatedly requested earlier matches. Carlos Alcaraz also categorically expressed his disapproval for the night session.“It’s really difficult to recover when you are going to go to sleep so, so late,” he said. “For me it’s much better to finish at 6pm, having dinner really, really well at restaurant, a good restaurant, good food. So everything is better if you finish early.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThose criticisms don’t even take into account the actual conditions. At the Australian and US Opens, the nights are warm. The cold conditions in Paris, though, make the clay courts even slower, the ball barely moving through the cold air. For much of Saturday’s match, Djokovic struggled to hit through Musetti’s excellent defence in conditions that resembled quicksand.These night sessions are also extremely difficult for all the other people involved in the sport. Fans should not need to make such a commitment for the sake of entertainment. The ballkids, many of whom are minors, and the linespeople should be able to return to their homes at an acceptable time. After midnight, there are few transport options for anyone leaving the site.What is clear is that the scheduling committees at tournaments need to be more flexible, more willing to move matches, to impose clear limits on when matches can begin and to change start times. The ATP and WTA tours have attempted to address the issue at their own non-slam events this year, initiating new match scheduling rules that include (three-set) matches not being allowed to start after 11pm and matches at 10.30pm requiring a move to an alternative court. It remains to be seen how effective they will be.Such is the unpredictable nature of professional tennis, a day after constant delays and an early morning finish, Sunday’s three-match day session was shorter than Djokovic’s match alone. By 4.31pm, the planned day session schedule was complete."}

That’s not to say footballers don’t have interesting things to say. There’s still excellent profiles, whether from journalists or increasingly from the clubs themselves. But when a footballer is wheeled out against their will, they invariably end up saying nothing. Three quarters of the population seem to speak like that now – bankers at Royal Commissions, local councillors, The Bachelor contestants and contested ball beasts. It’s the murder of words, and of meaning.Compared to America, the relationship between our superstars and the media is a little more strained and conditional. There are rules. Don’t criticise the opposition, your teammates, the umpires, the game plan, the media. Don’t smile after losses. Don’t adjust your headband. Don’t speak honestly after a few beers at the best and fairest. Don’t go on holiday at the end of the season. For players like Martin and Lance ‘Buddy’ Franklin, it’s often easier to opt out altogether.That’s not always a bad thing. Sometimes a little mystery, and a lot of silence, only adds to your appreciation of an athlete. Carlton champion Bruce Doull spoke only in emergencies. His football, teammate Brent Croswell later wrote, had “a moral purity about it.” His football said everything that needed to be said.On the flipside, and everything about him was on the flipside, there was Gary Ablett Snr. Gary perfected the art of saying absolutely nothing, yet still leaving the questioner open mouthed. I once saw him interviewed by Sam Newman, not a man easily impressed or awestruck. As Ablett trotted out his banalities, Newman was like a giddy schoolboy.Towards the end of his career, he started a newspaper column. He could surf the crest of a pack, prop, pivot, and slot a goal on his wrong foot with the ease of a man tying a shoelace. But he was no W.C Heinz. His column was a bust. He had one of our best sportswriters ghost-writing it, but Ablett was too guarded and too difficult to say anything remotely interesting. And every time that column was published, a little bit of the magic faded.Martin clearly isn’t the player he once was. After such a good run with injuries, his body’s accountants have started to redress the ledger. But he can still buckle his swash. On Saturday night, he had a full house, a game with weight, and a lot of people writing him off. His first quarter goal – the way he didn’t buckle at the spine, the shrug, the rapid steps, the predatory air that he projects like no other footballer I’ve seen – was a snapshot of everything that has made him great.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Australia SportGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Quinn Rooney/Getty ImagesHis performance said so much. What would dragging him kicking and screaming to a press conference, under the threat of a fine, actually achieve or reveal? The journalists would trundle in and he’d flick them down to fine leg. Would it satisfy what Hutchison called “an obligation to game”?Instead, whenever I watch him, I think of something Brendon Gale told Marshall in his book Yellow and Black. “You look at images of footballers and you know how they’ve got that startled, panicked look? You look at Dustin’s eyes in those moments and they reveal nothing. He’s like a shark. Like a great white, just cruising through the water. And then he strikes.”That’s the Dustin Martin I’ll always remember. That’s him holding up his end of the bargain. Those eyes, that voice, that moment he goes for the kill – the Dusty that says more than any interview or press conference ever could."}

Sometimes the games are tight and competitive but the ­superior player just wins all of the points that matter.This was not one of those matches. Across only 40 minutes, Swiatek destroyed the 41st-best female tennis player in the world. It was the ­shortest completed match of Swiatek’s career and Potapova won only 10 points. The Russian did not contest a deuce game and the closest she came to winning a game was at 30-30 in the second game. It was about as dominant a win as can be seen at grand-slam level.“Comfortable,” Swiatek said, describing what it feels like to be in the zone. “You just go with it because there’s no point of ­changing anything. You just continue what you’ve been doing and what has been working. But, honestly, I was always focusing on the next point. I didn’t really look at what happened before. So that was probably also why I could be efficient.”This is the fourth consecutive year that Swiatek has inflicted a double bagel on an opponent during the clay season and the second 6-0, 6-0 scoreline of her career at Roland Garros. Such is her notoriety for dismantling opponents, players following Swiatek on court now have to make sure they begin their warm-up routines early.“Usually if you’re after her, you know it’s probably going to be a quick match,” said Coco Gauff, who followed Swiatek on to Court Philippe-Chatrier. “So I figured the match would probably go an hour 15, an hour at the quickest. I definitely wasn’t expecting 40 minutes [but] it didn’t really affect much because I kind of knew. We planned for it.”Coco Gauff also won comfortably, losing only three games. Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesAs Swiatek continued her search for a third consecutive French Open title, she was joined in the ­quarter‑finals by the highest seeded players in the top half of the draw. She will next face Marketa Vondrousova, the Wimbledon champion and fifth seed, who defeated Olga Danilovic 6-4, 6-2. Gauff, the third seed, also won comfortably, beating Elisabetta Cocciaretto 6-1, 6-2, and she will face a resurgent Ons Jabeur, seeded eighth, who defeated Clara Tauson 6-4, 6-4.In the men’s draw the third seed, Carlos Alcaraz, continued to build form and confidence as he easily beat Félix Auger-Aliassime, the 21st seed, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 to reach the quarter-finals. He will face the ninth seed, ­Stefanos ­Tsitsipas, who demonstrated his mental toughness by recovering to defeat Matteo Arnaldi 3-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2, 6-2. Arnaldi had served for a two-set lead at 5-4 in the second set before Tsitsipas retrieved the break and took control.A tough match awaits ­Tsitsipas, who has not been able to solve the challenge of facing Alcaraz so far in his career. The Spaniard leads the head-to-head 5-0 and he has ­smothered Tsitsipas with drop shots in most of their matches, with the Greek so often unable to read them. Right after his fourth-round win, Alcaraz said he knew the key to defeating Tsitsipas.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionCarlos Alcaraz impressed on Sunday and will now face Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-finals. Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images“The matches that we’ve played, I won all of them,” he said. “So that’s what I wanted to mean when I said that I have the key against him. It doesn’t mean I have to play at my 50%. So I know that Stefanos is ­playing great, but I know tactically what I have to do in the match, which I’m not going to say, obviously, but I know what I have to do in the match.”While most top male ­players avoid doubles because of the best‑of‑five‑sets singles format, this week ­Tsitsipas committed to the triple crown in Paris. In addition to entering the doubles draw with his doubles specialist brother, Petros, he has also entered the mixed doubles draw with his girlfriend, Paula Badosa.Tsitsipas said in recent days: “­Playing doubles and mixed doubles, it is something that you think: ‘No one does it. Why should you do it? I realised after thinking about it that [I am] in a phase of my life where tennis really brings me joy and pleasure, and [I] want to be here and spend time with [my] loved ones also, but also focus professionally.”On Sunday evening, Jannik Sinner, the second seed, recovered from a set and a break down to reach the quarter-finals with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 win over Corentin Moutet, the last Frenchman in the draw."}

The great American cricket experiment got under way on Saturday night, when USA beat Canada by seven wickets in the opening match of the T20 World Cup at the little ground in Grand ­Prairie, Texas. And hell’s bells if it wasn’t, in its own little way, one of the game’s great occasions.A crowd of around 5,000 were treated to a brilliantly free­wheeling innings by USA’s Aaron Jones, a pocket-rocket batsman who was born in Queens and raised in ­Barbados. Jones clobbered 10 sixes, one of them clean out of the ground, in an undefeated innings of 94 off just 40 balls.It was an achievement to get the match on at all. A mini tornado ripped through here last Tuesday. It took out one of the giant screens and ripped out a stretch of the heavy metal railings around the ground. There had been four days of torrential rain and flash floods since, and a lot of the surrounding towns have been without power.The small team of staff have since been working around the clock, and the entire ground is being powered by temporary generators. But in the end the only real hitch was that they could have shifted a few more tickets. The high prices meant there were a few too many empty seats.The people who did turn up enjoyed a real treat. USA were heavy favourites given that they had recently won a series against Canada 4-0, and another against ­Bangladesh 2-1, but their bowlers seemed to be experiencing a few first-night nerves. Canada rattled off 40 runs from the opening four overs after being put in to bat. Their opener Aaron ­Johnson thrashed Muhammad Ali Khan’s very first ball for four. He scored three more in four balls of Khan’s second over, with four more in byes off a bouncer that ricocheted off his helmet.Johnson was caught at long-off but his opening partner, Navneet ­Dhaliwhal, pressed on. He walloped the first six of the tournament off the former India under-19 player Harmeet Singh.A crowd of around 5,000 people turned out for the World Cup opener in Dallas. Photograph: Matt Roberts/ICC/Getty ImagesDhaliwhal was joined by ­Nicholas Kirton in an entertaining 62-run stand for the fourth wicket. Kirton, who has quick hands and a handsome drive, collared a couple of crisp sixes over cover. Corey Anderson had Dhaliwhal caught at long-off with the first ball he bowled. Still, Kirton went on to make 51, and Canada’s total of 194 looked pretty daunting.Especially when USA were 40 for one after the first six overs, with opener Steven Taylor out lbw to the second ball of the innings. But that only brought in Jones. He put on 131 for the third wicket with Andries Gous.skip past newsletter promotionSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was ferocious going, and it rattled Canada. The game turned in the 14th over, when they brought their fast bowler Jeremy Gordon back into the attack. His first two overs cost only 11, but his third was studded with three sixes, two fours, three wides, and a catch off a no ball, and went for 33. USA romped home from there.So there were a few more ­Stetsons in the crowd, a heap more smoked brisket on sale, the stadium announcer had a southern twang, and if you looked hard enough there were one or two clues around the ground fit for the occasion, like the scoreboard listing the “balls” and “strikes” hanging from the balcony, and the ­Spanish translations on the signage (“Este Alerta! Cuidado con las pelotas!”). Mainly, though, it will just go down as a great game of T20 cricket, lit up by Jones’s extraordinary batting."}
{"title": "No ifs, no buts, this Real Madrid rank alongside Di Stéfano’s as greatest team ever | Real Madrid | The Guardian", "caption": "Six European Cups in a decade is an achievement to match any, even that one from 1956-1960, untouchable in black and white", "author": "Sid Lowe", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/article/2024/jun/02/real-madrid-di-stefano-greatest-team-ever-european-cup", "text": "Dani Carvajal laid the first stone and applied the final brush stroke. In May 2004, when he was a 12-year-old kid with floppy blond hair and a lifetime before him, he placed Real Madrid’s white shirt into the foundations of their training ground, a new home for an institution that, the legend carved into that granite slab said, “respects its past, learns from its present and believes in its future”. On the first day of June 2024, now a 32-year-old man with a greying beard and a history behind him, he was in Madrid colours at Wembley, leaping to head in the goal that helped secure their greatest work of all.Twenty years had passed almost to the day, and it was done. How much longer before anyone witnesses this again, if they do? That day Carvajal, an infantil in the academy, stood alongside a 77-year-old Alfredo Di Stéfano, the most significant player whom club football has had, a symbol of their everything; the man whose arrival in 1953 changed Madrid and the game for ever, forging their legend, an identity. Now, when it comes to the European Cup, the competition in which they did it and feel as their own, Carvajal stands above him. Even saying it sounds absurd, a glimpse of what has just happened.No one has won this competition more times. A tiny, select group have won it as many. Five men have lifted the European Cup six times and three of them are Carvajal’s teammates: on Saturday he, Luka Modric, Nacho Fernández and Toni Kroos joined Paco Gento, whose seemingly impossible feat has taken 58 years, and one prodigious decade, to match. Carvajal is the only one of this generation to have started all six finals, although he was forced off early in two, his tears there adding poignancy to the goal that pulled them through here.“I came as a kid and now I’m here,” he said. “It is going to be very hard for this [record] to be taken away from us.”There were many images, words and moments to hold on to at the end of Real Madrid’s 15th – fifteenth – European Cup. Kroos leaving like that. Vinícius Júnior scoring another Champions League final goal, at 23: “Ballon d’Or, no doubt,” Carlo Ancelotti, the Madrid manager, said. Jude Bellingham, winning the trophy for the first time, aged 20, who said he was holding it together until he saw his mum’s and dad’s faces. Ancelotti intervening again, with calm clarity. “He knows what he is doing,” Bellingham had said. There was the way they did it, which is their way, a story seen before. They had been let off alive, Ancelotti admitted, but they had done it.Jude Bellingham sits with his brother, Jobe, as their parents Mark and Denise talk in the background after the Champions League final. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The ObserverYou didn’t seriously think they wouldn’t, did you? They have not lost a final in the competition since 1981: played nine, won nine. “It seems that in these games, we’re not able to lose,” Kroos said. “To be level with Gento is crazy, something I never thought I am going to achieve.”Through all those images, those little vignettes, there was that basic fact, the thing it all built to, that expresses the enormity of this: Real Madrid had just won their 15th European Cup. Now they will ask for the 16th, Ancelotti was told, to which he started laughing. When he eventually stopped, he replied: “It is like that.” As if to prove the point, the president, Florentino Pérez, then said exactly that and this week he will announce Kylian Mbappé’s arrival. But it is a stock phrase. That’s tomorrow and this is now, and always. Forget the next one, at least for a while. Stop. Take it in. Don’t look forward, look back.Because this is about emulating the eternal, surpassing it even, less perhaps about the 15th than about it being Madrid’s sixth in 10 years: from Lisbon to London, 2014 to 2024. No one has ever done this, except them. Four of this team have won as many European Cups as Liverpool, never mind Gento, the only Madrid player who won their first five European Cups, from 1956-60, and their sixth in 1966.The ’66 team, known as the Madrid of the Ye-Ye, a transliteration of the chorus from the Beatles’ She Loves You, stood apart, an outlier. Madrid had been knocked out for the first time in 1960 – by Barcelona – and lost the finals in 1962 and 1964. Di Stéfano had gone and economically they were not in good health. The team that beat Partizan in the 1966 final was made up entirely of Spaniards.Alfredo Di Stéfano (right), scores Real Madrid’s first goal in 7-3 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1960 European Cup final at Hampden Park. Photograph: APIf that contributes to this current side perhaps not being seen as emulating Madrid’s golden generation, embodied by winning the first five European Cups rather than six in the opening decade, there are other elements too. That team built Madrid’s identity and comes with an aura of invincibility, of dominance, an imperious march to the title, that this generation may not match. Instead there is the implausibility of these successes: the miracles, the fortune, the goalkeepers suddenly losing their minds, the plain silliness of some of their wins. Even they agreed 2022 was pretty ridiculous. When they were defeated 4-0 by Manchester City the following year in the semi-final second leg, some saw it as justice and the end.“There’s always a ‘but’,” Ancelotti has said. Rodrygo admitted recently that Manchester City were “better” than them. In this final, again they were made to suffer. The run from 2014 began in the season in which Atlético Madrid were domestic champions, and in the final it took a 93rd‑minute equaliser and an extra-time barrage to beat them. In two of the three they won in a row between 2016 and 2018, Barcelona were La Liga champions and that, Madrid’s then coach Zinedine Zidane admitted, was the most objective test, the title he most valued.And yet as Kroos presciently said after that elimination in Manchester: “It is not normal to win the Champions League all the time. The last time I heard it was the end of an era was 2019, so we’re OK.” He was right, they were OK; better than that, better than anyone. No buts, this is inescapable: six European Cups in a decade, an achievement to match any, even that one, untouchable in black and white. Sometimes you need to step back from the history you’re making to see that you’re making it. Time changes perceptions, of this era and that one; the past is seen differently and one day this will be the past and it will be glorious.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ferenc Puskas once recalled that Barcelona’s Hungarians would wind him up because they seemed to be able to “do us whenever they wanted”. During the first five years that Madrid won the European Cup, they were Spanish champions twice; Athletic and Barcelona won the league three times between them. When they won the sixth, Atlético won the league. Five teams – Athletic, Barcelona, Atlético, Deportivo, Valencia – have been champions of Spain when Madrid have been champions of Europe.But so what? Six in a decade, for goodness’ sake. And, actually, this Madrid have a better league record than the golden generation. Madrid: European champions. It’s started to look obvious, feel inevitable, when it is not. After 1966, Madrid went 32 years without lifting the trophy that makes them. They won it again in 2000 and 2002, although from the seventh to the ninth, those were different looking teams and different eras, only Roberto Carlos, Raúl and Fernando Morientes starting all three finals, with Zidane scoring that iconic volley at the end of his debut season.Zinedine Zidane, who won the European Cup as a player and manager with Real Madrid, places the trophy for the presentation at Wembley. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The ObserverThe galácticos had come, glory assured. But they got stuck. The 10th tortured them; the décima became an obsession and it resisted them for more than a decade. Six years in a row, they didn’t manage to win a knockout game. Twelve years they waited, which felt like an eternity, and eventually reached the final in 2014. With the clock on 92.48 they were losing, and to Atlético of all teams: that Sergio Ramos header is surely the single most sliding-doors moment in their history. “Every morning when he comes in, I feel like kissing him,” Paul Clement, Ancelotti’s assistant, said. The most traumatic of ends awaited them, everything about to be ripped up.Instead, it was the beginning. Madrid had the 10th. Two years later they had the 11th, then the 12th and the 13th in a row, which was extraordinary enough. That cycle appeared to be closing. Players went – Cristiano Ronaldo, Ramos, Gareth Bale, Casemiro, Raphaël Varane – and so did the coaches. Ancelotti had been sacked within a year and then Zidane – who had begun as his assistant and was now the competition’s most successful manager – departed.Madrid were struggling to find a replacement. One day José Ángel Sánchez, the director general, received a call from Ancelotti about the possibility of Everton taking Madrid players on loan. At one point the Italian asked him how the search was going. Not good, he was told. To which Ancelotti joked, well, there is one obvious candidate, the best coach in the world.Within a day it was done; within three years, Madrid lifted the decimocuarta and the decimoquinta, the best decade the biggest club of all have had, opening and closing with the competition’s most successful manager on the bench and four of its five most successful players on the pitch. The kid who had laid the first stone 20 years earlier provided the final touch, their work complete."}

This question is insane.”“There are people in Europe who’ve had to flee because of war, economic factors, environmental disasters, people who simply want to be taken in,” he continued. “We have to ask what are we doing at the moment? We in Germany are doing very, very well, and when we say something like that, I think it’s crazy how we turn a blind eye and simply block out such things.”Nagelsmann also said Kimmich was correct when he said a football team can be a role model for how different cultural, religious and ethnic backgrounds can join in a group successfully to work together for major goals.“I always find it bizarre that we all go on vacation to get to know other cultures and then other cultures come here and we complain about it. It’s bizarre,” Nagelsmann said. “So, I can’t go on vacation then. I always have to stay where I am.”“We’re playing a European Championship for everyone in the country,” the 36-year-old added. “And anyone who can play top football is invited to be a national player and give their all for their country. And that’s what we’re doing. And I hope I never have to read about such a crap survey again.”Germany will play Ukraine on Monday in Nuremberg, in the hosts’ first warmup game for Euro 2024.

He was trending on Twitter. ‘Sack Lyon. Ross ruins footy. Saints are unwatchable.’ was the general theme. They had just given up two late goals and the lead. Harley Reid, with 17 touches and seven clearances, was torching them.Lyon recently compared himself to a neutered dog. When he said it, he had the mournful look of a Saint Bernard that’s just had the cruellest cut. On and off the field, he can’t exert the same influence he used to. Coaching has changed so much and the frustration of men like Lyon and Clarkson is obvious.They can’t rule like a dictator anymore – they’d lose the current generation of players within a week if they tried. And they don’t have the same levers to manipulate play during a game. The 6-6-6 rule and the restricted use of runners have quelled that.Players like Scott Pendlebury who double as on-field coaches are worth their weight in gold. Coaches need what Mark Thompson used to call “mini versions of me” and there’s not many of those at St Kilda.But as Lyon says, it’s easier to destruct than to create, and there’s still a place for an old-fashioned clampdown. He has a history with taggers. Clinton Jones did a job for him every week at St Kilda, and Ryan Crowley used highly unorthodox methods to drive opposition midfielders nuts for years at Fremantle.“Reid lit ‘em up, so we’ll put time into him,” Lyon said. This was no “cooler”. Marcus Windhager parked himself in Reid’s back pocket for an hour, blanketed him, frustrated him, humbled him, and helped deliver a desperately needed four points.Harley Reid is already a considerable presence on the football field. He throws his weight around and shows no respect for his opposition elders. “Confidence and cheek,” he calls it.Superstar juniors often get a rude shock at the senior level. They get found out and worked over. But in less than a dozen games, Reid has been standing over and running away from champions, from North Smith medallists, and from 300 game players.That confidence, that cheek, and that raw power was personified in one passage of play a fortnight ago when he streamed away, his head high, his tongue hanging out, from Melbourne midfielder Christian Petracca. The extravagance of his bouncing technique, at full speed, with one of the best footballers of his generation chasing, was quite a sight. It’s why the Eagles, who were playing park level footy not long ago, are now one of the must-watches each weekend. Whenever Reid gets the ball, the boos at Optus Stadium turn into a low-level squeal.This is a young player who’s been feted all throughout his junior career, who has clubs offering $2m deals, and who’s been built up in the Perth press like no-one since Ben Cousins.But he was brought down a peg or two on the weekend. He had just three touches in the second half. He gave away four free kicks, including a downfield free that gifted St Kilda the sealer. Harassed and teetering on petulant, he probably cost himself the Rising Star award when he slung Darcy Wilson to the turf.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Australia SportGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After all, both Toby Greene and Dustin Martin were ineligible for the award and they’ve turned out ok. But he has a target on his back now.Lyon’s Saints, as always, did it the hard way. As always, the effort was there. The first quarter aside, it was an entertaining contest. They won it with Windhager’s tag, with Mason Wood’s tank, and with Jack Steele’s 15 tackles. But it threw up all the usual question marks – the lack of stars and forward potency and most glaringly, the plain midfield.This round showcased some extraordinary midfield talent – Nick Daicos’ opening, Reid’s second term, Patrick Cripps’ five-minute burst and Marcus Bontempelli’s entire game. But Lyon doesn’t have anywhere near that level of talent. After his midfield had been trounced by GWS’s Josh Kelly, Tom Green and co in last year’s elimination final, he lamented the lack of stars. “I can’t just head to Woolworths on Glenhuntly Rd and buy one,” he said.Lyon still has a few tricks up his sleeve, as he demonstrated at half-time. But the most important levers at a footy club are beyond a coach these days. They’re in recruiting, in list management, and in attracting free agents, areas where St Kilda has not excelled for a long time. It’s why, in interviews, Lyon oscillates between the droll, the doleful and the neutered, a man who can still win the battle, but who’s losing the war."}

Rob, by then, could no longer talk and, in his wheelchair, he could barely move. Motor neurone disease had made him a prisoner in his own body. I was anxious before we began because it seemed an impossible task. Rob, however, had spent much of his life proving that he could overcome preconceptions.He was the rugby league giant who, despite being 5ft 5in tall and weighing a shade over 10 stone, had played almost 500 games for Leeds Rhinos, and won eight Super League championships and 18 international caps.He dazzled and tackled opponents who were often double his weight and stood more than a foot taller than him.From his earliest junior years right the way through to all those grand finals, Rob had ripped up doubts that he was too small to make it. Instead, he had left a huge mark on rugby league and become one of the most cherished players in Britain.So Rob soon showed me how we might work together. He used a device called Eyegaze to answer my questions. Rob would pick out individual letters on a monitor and, by using his eyes, build words and then sentences. When he was ready to reply he would turn to me and his wife, Lindsey, with a smile. Lindsey and I knew that it was time for us to stop talking. In the sudden silence Rob would use his eyes to play a recording of his reply. It felt like magic to hear his voice, and that unvarnished Castleford accent, suddenly brought to life.All this was possible because, in the months after his diagnosis for MND, he had read a book out loud so that a computer could store his voice and recreate the words he wanted to say when he was rendered speechless for ever. Despite the gravity of his condition, Rob still made me laugh.Burrow left a huge mark on rugby league and was one of the most cherished players. Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAHe said that, even though he didn’t like hearing himself, it was far better that his answers came in his own accent “rather than an American robot voice like Stephen Hawking”.So, 16 months after he had been told he had less than two years to live, Rob and I were able to talk. It was a long, slow and exhausting process for him but he was determined to complete our interview. We had three sessions together over two weeks and, as he reflected on the meaning of his life and looming death, Rob also spent many hours using Eyegaze to email me his more complex and free‑flowing replies. The interview ran as an amalgam of his “live” answers via Eyegaze and his emailed insights.The first were much shorter, of course, but they were moving. “I appreciate the simple things,” Rob’s voice said as it boomed out of the computer. “I don’t have a bucket list because I’ve had such a wonderful life. However, I want to make the most of the time I have left.”It took him almost 10 minutes to formulate that answer – which gave me an insight into how testing life had become for Rob. And then I would wake to some extraordinary emails, which amplified those thoughts, as Rob had spent so much time on his own to add texture and depth to his replies.“I have changed my opinion about living in the moment,” he wrote to me late one night. “Since my diagnosis I see the moment as it is and find meaning in it. When the kids are playing in the garden or purely having fun, it makes me appreciate the moment. One day, before I know it, I won’t be able to enjoy these timeless moments. When I tell Lindsey and the kids I love them, you never know how far you are from telling them that for the last time.”Burrow played almost 500 games for Leeds Rhinos and won eight Super League championships. Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersRob was only 41 when he died. He and Lindsey had been together, apart from a brief break when she was at university, since they were 15. It was an immense love story that became even more moving in the often harrowing last year of his life. Lindsey’s care for him never wavered.I have been to their home often in recent months and, as it became increasingly difficult for Rob to swallow even mashed food, Lindsey still found ways to help him. She maintained her steady source of good cheer, talking brightly or gently to Rob, even though he was too frail and exhausted to respond with much more than a “Yes” or a “No” on the Eyegaze machine.But a flickering fire still burned inside him. He wanted to live as long as possible. Rob always said that he would accept the diagnosis of MND, a disease of almost unbearable cruelty, but that he would fight the prognosis which, on that terrible day in December 2019, told him that he could only expect to live for another 18 months or, at most, two years.His wife Lindsey’s care never wavered throughout a relationship which started when they were 15. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIn the end, Rob lived for more than four and a half years. In that time he won awards and he was loved and exalted even more than when he played for Leeds. But, far more importantly, he loved every day that he saw his three young children – Macy, Maya and Jackson – run across to him with such love and life. They are pretty amazing kids and it says so much for Rob, and Lindsey, that they have flourished despite their dad being in the merciless grip of MND.Lindsey messaged me last Tuesday evening to tell me that Rob had been hospitalised with pneumonia. She said she was trying to remain positive but she knew how ill he had become. It was a distressing echo of the events of last summer when she had feared that a different bout of pneumonia would hasten the end of Rob’s life. But he rallied then and was able to return home.His recovery made me think of what he had once told me about his rugby league career. “I played to my strengths,” Rob said. “I had speed and agility. I didn’t try to be anything I wasn’t. I never had any doubts. I’m tougher than I look.”He almost laughed when he said those words but the sound was trapped in his body.The mighty Rob Burrow was one of the most extraordinary men I have met. He was definitely the toughest. But when I heard on Sunday that death had finally come for him, offering a merciful release after he had suffered so long, I also thought how he had told me of his good fortune.Death was never far from our conversations but Rob’s words were always more tender than they were sombre. The breath caught in the back of my throat when he wrote this line: “There’s something beautiful about being cared for by the only girl you’ve ever loved.”Lindsey was with Rob until the very end, showing him the love and the care that had sustained him so long."}

I’m a very optimistic person and through this all, I always perhaps egomaniacally assumed that everything we did would be successful. At the same time the pressures were immense and for me getting stoned definitely buffered me from a lot of tensions and helped me tunnel- vision more of it.Debbie met Jane Fonda, and one afternoon, Jane and Kris Kristofferson, who were filming Rollover, came to our apartment and we sat around smoking weed and watching The Tin Drum. I would just keep smoking indefinitely, and by then I always had really great pot. I generally leaned towards indica if I could get it.We dumped most of the dope in the plane toilet but put a small amount in a cuff of Debbie’s pantsJane and Debbie dropped out after four joints or so but Kristofferson kept pace with me. Bowie came over a couple of times and signed our David Bowie records. We had a party he was at that I don’t remember much of. We didn’t throw a lot of parties but we would frequently have people at our place.We got to the UK as the Soviets were getting ready to invade Afghanistan on Christmas Eve. Right at the onset we did an in-store appearance at Our Price Records on Kensington High Street. We’d been there previously and a lot of people, hundreds, had shown up to get autographs. This time there were a few thousand. The cops closed off the street. We went up to an office on the second floor and when Debbie stuck her head out the window and waved, the crowd cheered like they’d seen a goal at a football match.Chris Stein at home in New York. Photograph: Mike McGregor/The ObserverIt took hours to sign autographs in the store and when we left, we were crushed by crowds and almost left Nigel [Harrison, bassist] behind in the scramble to get on the bus. This kept happening. At many shows we had to push our way though a surging crowd as we were leaving. Beyond a few scrapes, no one was seriously injured. We picked up bodyguard Steve English. Steve was a total British OG hard-man type, a bright guy with a great sense of humor. He was (and still is) huge and powerful, like a human wall. Steve had been Johnny Rotten’s bodyguard and had kept him from being impaled on various occasions.Everything had a Christmas vibe. Debbie and me went on Swap Shop, a popular young people’s TV show, and the audience called in live. It was all little kids. It was amazing; all these sweet-sounding children loved Debbie. I was watching an old Blondie show video without the sound on recently and I realized that Debbie comes off as part little kid doing a pretend show in front of a mirror and part erudite, glamorous, risky woman. Top of the Pops was Dreaming this time; it had gotten to No 2. I don’t remember if the BBC had given up on the fake-recording-to-placate-the-union- gods thing by then.Debbie Harry and Chris Stein in New York, 1978. Photograph: Roberta Bayley/RedfernsBehind everything was this lingering drug situation. Cocaine was everywhere all the time. We would meet some big celebrity and he would pull a bag of blow out of his pocket. But a lot of people were doing heroin as well. People we knew were functioning addicts. We began seeing a guy named Al who turned us on to the art of chasing dragons. A simple form that still requires a little technique – it’s just inhaling the smoke of the dope while it is burned on tinfoil. We had screwed around with sniffing heroin already, but smoking it was pretty insidious. One night a neighbor of ours got mugged in Central Park. He fought off his attacker but got banged up and came over to our apartment. He was all bruised, so we chased some dragons with him without mentioning what it was. I think he thought it was some form of weed. He definitely left feeling better. That was the problem; it made you feel better.At one point in one of the eternal Blondie tours, everyone was about to travel from Switzerland to Paris. Somebody in Zurich had given Debbie and me a bunch of heroin. As we were boarding the plane, after Debbie, Clem, and I went through the metal detector, one of the crew guys right behind us had a metal container of hashish in his shirt pocket that set off the alarm and he got nabbed. Everyone in the band and crew from the culprit back was taken away. Two security guys came on the plane and told us they’d be removing our luggage to investigate and asked if we wanted to leave the flight and accompany our bags as they were searched. Clem left; Debbie and me said no, thanks, and stayed on the flight. We did have this fairly large quantity of drugs with us and we became concerned lest we get busted arriving in Paris. We dumped most of the dope in the plane toilet but put a small amount in a cuff of Debbie’s pants. Of course nobody even looked at us when we landed, and we spent the afternoon stoned, wandering around the Champs-Élysées while everyone else sat around in an office at the Zurich airport in their underwear."}

Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions are rising and enormous fossil fuel projects continue to be approved to meet domestic and international demand.While any reasonable person understands that Rome wasn’t built in a day, the truth is that we are still not doing enough to address the root cause of our rapidly warming planet. The IPCC – the world’s authority on climate science – has very clearly demonstrated that the burning of coal, oil and gas is the primary cause of climate change. No matter which way you look at it, fossil fuels are cooking the planet.And right now Australian taxpayers are footing the bill to keep the fossil fuel industry on life support. According to the Australia Institute, the government collects more money from the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) than it does from the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT), a federal tax levied on petroleum, oil and gas projects in Australian waters. In 2022/23 the government collected nearly $2.3bn from the PRRT, less than half the $4.9bn generated from student loan repayments.In his National Press Club address in January 2024, Richard Denniss, the executive director of the Australia Institute, said: “Consider the fact that in Norway they tax the fossil fuel industry and give kids free university education, in Australia we subsidise the fossil fuel industry and charge kids a fortune to go to university.” And it’s not just young people doing it tough. In 2020/21, nurses paid more than three times the income tax the gas industry paid in income tax and the PRRT combined. Clearly we have things backwards.The scientific reality is, regardless of the political spin used to justify the continued exploitation of fossil fuel reserves, the laws of physics will keep warming the planet until we stop pumping carbon into the atmosphere and begin cleaning up the mess. The situation is too far gone for renewable energy alone to save us. Pinning our hopes on carbon capture technology to justify the continued burning of fossil fuels is a disastrous gamble the world can’t afford to take. So, are the climate wars really over, or has a new era of greenwashing just begun?We know exactly how to put the brakes on global warming – the IPCC has been saying it for at least 30 yearsEvents of recent years have graphically showcased how underprepared Australia is for the impacts we’ve already experienced with 1.2C of global warming, let alone the conditions we will experience in the future. According to the United Nations Environment Program, there is a 90% chance that the continuation of current climate policies will result in 2.3C to 4.5C of global warming by the end of century, with a best estimate of 3.5C. This represents a catastrophic overshooting of the Paris agreement targets, highlighting just how far off track we really are. The lower limit of 1.5C is expected to be breached in the early 2030s, with 2C reached in the 2040s – within the lifetime of most people alive today.The consequences of such high levels of warming on the Australian way of life and on our national security, health and unique ecosystems are profound and immeasurable. To force our political leaders to do better, we need to wake up to the fact that we are the last generation that will experience the world as we know it today: the last to experience the tropical wonders of the Great Barrier Reef, summers uninterrupted by life-threatening storms, and the awe of wild places before they succumb irrevocably to the ravages of fire and intolerable heat.Australia is in peril, and yet the consequences of a warming planet on our sunburnt country are still poorly understood by most people outside of the scientific community, let alone by our government. In 2023 a national study of just over 4,000 Australians was published by Queensland’s Griffith University showing a major disconnection between the scientific reality of climate change and the public’s perception of the severity of the problem.‘As the third-largest exporter of fossil fuels, what Australia chooses to do over the next five years is critical for the stabilisation of the Earth’s climate.’ Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAPAlthough three-quarters of Australians surveyed accept that climate change is real, only 15% think it is an “extremely serious” problem right now. The poll showed that while close to a third of people believed climate change will be an issue in 2050, the urgency of addressing the problem was not appreciated.The most interesting result for me was that about a quarter of Australians do not understand or accept the science and the reality of the threats posed by climate change, identifying as deniers, sceptical or unconvinced. I would have expected this a decade ago, but surely these results don’t reflect the reality of today – or do they?To get a sense of how representative the Griffith University study might be, I tracked down a 2023 global survey of views on climate change. To my surprise, this polling also showed a disturbing lack of awareness of the scientific reality of climate change more than half of the Australians surveyed claimed that the impacts in our region have not been severe, with a third of people believing that the media exaggerates the influence of global warming.These perceptions may help explain why governments remain committed to only advancing modest climate policies that have broad electoral appeal. People are willing to install solar panels on their roof if it saves them money on their power bills, but they switch off when the harder conversation around the urgency of shutting down the fossil fuel industry begins.Should Australia go nuclear? Why Peter Dutton's plan could be an atomic failure – videoMost people are willing to let the government kick that can down the road, as many Australians still don’t consider climate change an urgent issue that personally affects them or even understand the reality of the threats we face as a nation – not in some distant future, but right now. Today.Meanwhile, those of us who do try to communicate the dangers of unmitigated climate change to the public feel like a broken record. We know exactly how to put the brakes on global warming – the IPCC has been saying it for at least 30 years.We need our politicians to listen and have the heart and the courage to do the right thing. But for them to do what they know is right, ordinary Australians need to care about the future of our planet and vote for leaders who reflect the values of our local communities. As our next federal election approaches, we need a critical mass of people willing to create a social tipping point that demands our leaders do better.What happens at the next federal election really matters. As the third-largest exporter of fossil fuels, what Australia chooses to do over the next five years is critical for the stabilisation of the Earth’s climate. We still have a chance to determine how bad things get and which areas can be saved, but only if we genuinely reduce emissions. Photograph: Black IncThe most urgent thing we need to do is phase out our use of fossil fuels and invest heavily in renewables like our life depends on it. Because it does. What we do during the 2020s will make or break humanity’s ability to live safely on the planet.We have world-class knowledge and know-how right here in Australia; we can do this if we have the political will.This is an edited extract from Quarterly Essay 94, Highway to Hell – Climate Change and Australia’s Future, by Joelle Gergis, out now"}

About 35,000 under-50s are now developing cancer every year, almost 100 young women and men a day, the research reveals.Meanwhile, there is mounting concern that a global epidemic of cancer among young people may be emerging. The explosion in cases was a key focus of discussion this weekend at the world’s largest cancer conference, the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).Experts are still in the early stages of understanding the reasons behind the rise in cases. But most believe poor diets, physical inactivity and obesity are likely to be among the factors behind the surge in cancer rates among young people in the UK.Incidence rates have grown among all ages in the last two decades. But the 24% increase among the under-50s is much higher than the rises seen among other age groups.Prof Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK’s chief clinician, said: “Over recent decades, there has been a clear increase in cancer incidence rates in young adults in the UK. Evidence suggests that more adults under 50 may be getting cancer than ever before.”The second biggest rise in cases was among the under-25s. Their rate increased 16%, from 16.6 cases per 100,000 in 1995 to 19.2 in 2019.Bar chartThe overall incidence rate of cancer cases across all ages grew from 539 per 100,000 people in 1995 to 611.5 in 2019, according to the Cancer Research UK analysis. That represents an uptick of 13% – almost half the growth rate among the under-50s.In those aged 50 to 74, the incidence rate climbed 14%, from 955.1 to 1,092. In the over-75s there was a 10% rise, from 2,259.7 cases per 100,000 people to 2,482.7 cases. It means the rate rise in the under-50s was more than double that of the over-75s.Early onset cancers are still uncommon. About 90% of all cancers affect people over the age of 50.But the trend was still “worrying”, Swanton said, with 34,945 cases in 2019, according to the analysis. That total is up 34% from 26,176 in 1995. The reason the percentage change is greater than the 24% rate rise is likely because of population growth.“Although these cases are a small proportion of the overall population and still relatively uncommon, the trend is important, and it requires further investigation,” said Swanton.Researchers are still in the early stages of working out why cancer may be becoming a young person’s disease, but clues are already emerging, he said.“Increased exposure to known as well as unknown cancer risk factors, changes to lifestyles and diets over time, and rising obesity may all contribute to the uptick in early-onset cancer.” Swanton said.Britain has one of the highest obesity rates in Europe, with two in three adults in the UK overweight or obese.“Genetics, improvements in diagnosis and screening and the microbiome could also play a role,” said Swanton. “We are seeing them through our clinics and it is disturbing and we don’t have a good answer as to why this is happening. It really is a scientific conundrum that urgently needs to be solved.”The surge in early onset cases is a global problem. The number of under-50s affected worldwide has rocketed by almost 80%, the Guardian reported last year.A recent review of registry records from 44 countries found the incidence of early onset cancers was rising rapidly for bowel and 13 other types, many of which affect the digestive system.Dr Aparna Parikh, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard medical school and an oncologist at Massachusetts general hospital, is part of Team Prospect, an international research group funded by Cancer Research UK that is studying the spike in cases.Speaking at the ASCO conference, she said: “We want to gain a deep mechanistic understanding of biological processes and environmental causes, and to do this we’re looking at a diverse set of data and patients from all around the world.”The boom in cases was complex, Parikh said, but added that it was likely to be “driven by various factors, including diet, the environment, and features of the microbiome”.One study presented at the ASCO meeting added to evidence that poor diets were contributing to rising cases of bowel cancer among the under-50s.Ohio State University said the balance of bacteria and inflammation in the gut, both of which are affected by what people eat, could cause “accelerated ageing” in the colon.Swanton said that while researchers raced to unlock more answers, there were multiple ways people could reduce their risk.“Around four in 10 cancer cases are preventable, and there are steps people can take to help reduce their cancer risk,” he said. “Not smoking, keeping a healthy weight, being safe in the sun and cutting down on alcohol all makes a big difference.”"}

Scientists explain what’s behind the rise – and the best ways to improve neurodivergent lives", "author": "Ian Sample", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/01/the-truth-about-adhd-and-autism-how-many-people-have-it-what-causes-it-and-why-are-diagnoses-soaring", "text": "It was in the mid 90s that neurodiversity as a formal concept and a rights movement began to emerge. Aided by the internet, autistic people and those with other conditions were able to connect and began sharing their experiences: what they had in common, how their lives differed. A recurring theme was how many felt marginalised, pushed out of a society that embraced only typical ways of being in the world. The phrase “neurological diversity” cropped up in their discussions, which along with “neurodiversity” appeared in magazine articles later that decade.Neurodiversity has clear parallels with biodiversity. It champions difference and the validity of individuals. It holds that a vaguely defined majority can be described as neurotypical, with brains that operate in a broadly similar way. Others, meanwhile, are neurodivergent, with brains that are built and work somewhat differently.Neurodivergent people may be diagnosed with a range of conditions, and many co-occur in the same individual. There is no definitive list, but autism (and what was once known as Asperger’s syndrome) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common, as are dyslexia, a learning difficulty that affects reading and writing, and dyspraxia, which manifests as difficulties in movement and coordination.One of the most powerful things neurodiversity has done for neurodivergent people is give us a way of conceptualising ourselves as fundamentally worthyAs a concept and a movement, neurodiversity is reshaping thinking in science, social science and medicine. Neurodivergent people are more involved in the research and in the language used to describe them. Questions are being asked about research priorities, ethics, consent and whether studies will really benefit neurodivergent people.Interwoven with the concept of neurodiversity is an ongoing shift that embraces a social model of disability. It posits that many of the disabilities neurodivergent people experience are not caused by “something wrong” in the brain, but reflect the friction that arises when a neurodivergent person moves through a neurotypical world. The barriers they face, then, should be reduced, and if possible removed, by making society more accommodating.“There has absolutely been a change of ethos and tone,” says Professor Francesca Happé of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King’s College London. “We no longer talk about curing or treating autism, for example, but we do try and improve the things that go along with it, like anxiety and depression, bad sleep and epilepsy, intellectual disability and language impairment.”The concept of neurodiversity has been a powerful force at the individual level. Dr Monique Botha, who is autistic and a research fellow in psychology at the University of Stirling, interviewed autistic people for their PhD. One man recounted how some people chose not to vaccinate their children against particular infections for fear of them developing autism. The claim that vaccines drive autism has been vigorously demolished, but the man’s point was that some parents would rather risk their child catching a potentially lethal infection than be autistic.“It was a real moment of understanding the stigma attached to autism,” says Botha. “One of the most powerful things that neurodiversity has done for neurodivergent people is give us a way of conceptualising ourselves as fundamentally worthy, regardless of how disability is perceived by others.”About 15% of the global population are said to be neurodivergent. In the UK, at least 1% of people are thought to have an autistic spectrum condition and about 4% have ADHD. Dyslexia, dyspraxia and dyscalculia (difficulty in understanding numbers) sit at about 10%, 6% and 6% respectively. They are regarded as neurodevelopmental conditions: consequences of how the brain forms in the womb or early childhood, and many overlap.The official numbers weren’t always so high. Rewind the clock 40 years and doctors talked of four, perhaps six, in every 10,000 people being autistic. Today, records suggest 1-3% of the world’s population are autistic.Diagnoses of ADHD have similarly surged. Those affected tend to have difficulties focusing; they may act impulsively and struggle to sit still. In the UK, diagnoses in secondary school boys have more than doubled in two decades. In adults under 30 there has been a 20-fold rise. More people are being diagnosed for the first time in adulthood.In the US, the steady rise in autism diagnoses has been described as an “epidemic”, a word best reserved for infectious diseases, and which implies autism itself is rising. For many researchers that doesn’t ring true. The increase, they believe, is down to other factors such as changes in the way autism is defined.In the 1980s, doctors looked for a “pervasive lack of responsiveness” to others and “gross deficits” in language development. Now they cast a wider net, recording autism on seeing “persistent deficits” in areas such as social communication and interaction, alongside restricted, repetitive behaviours, such as lining up toys, insisting on the same daily schedule and having intense fixations.Sensory sensitivities feature too, as with ADHD. People can be hypersensitive to bright lights, particular sounds, smells, tastes or textures. Or they might be hyposensitive and seek out certain kinds of stimulation, or struggle to sense when they are hungry, ill or in pain.But shifts in definition are only one driver. There is a greater awareness of autism today, and doctors do a better job of spotting the condition where it was previously under-diagnosed. This is particularly evident in girls, adults and people of colour. “I think the majority of the rise is due to changes in diagnoses, understanding and awareness,” says Dr Cathy Manning, a psychologist at the University of Birmingham. “It is not necessarily that there are more autistic people than there were before, it’s that we’re now actually diagnosing them and reporting that they have those diagnoses.”There’s rarely an identifiable cause in a particular individual, but scientists suspect DNA underpins 80% of autism and ADHDPeople are missed for all manner of reasons. The stereotype of autism as a male condition (the diagnosis is four times more common in males than females) is one factor. Teachers might notice the boy who constantly walks the playground perimeter while the rest play football, but they overlook the girl who copies everything about a school friend in an effort to fit in. Such masking occurs in both sexes and is damaging in itself.“Autistic people tell us it’s exhausting and can erode your sense of self,” says Happé, “because you might make friends, but not feel like they are real friends, because they are friends with your mask rather than you.”Similar forces are at work in ADHD. In the late 90s, diagnosis required onset before seven years old and evidence of “impairment” in several settings. The age has now been pushed up to 12 and children need only show “symptoms” in some settings. Before 2013, ADHD and autism were officially mutually exclusive. If you had one, you could not be diagnosed with the other.One of the earliest descriptions of autism came in 1943, when Leo Kanner, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University hospital in Maryland, documented “infantile autism”. Kanner published notes on eight boys and three girls who all displayed what he called “autistic disturbances”. One, Donald Triplett, became known as the first person to receive an autism diagnosis. Seen by Kanner at the age of five, Triplett seemed to “live within himself”, learned endless pictures in an encyclopaedia, and delighted in spinning “anything he could seize upon”. Some of his responses were fascinating. Asked to subtract four from 10, Triplett said: “I’ll draw a hexagon.”Kanner didn’t know the causes. The children he assessed had “come into the world” with an “innate inability” to form the usual social connections, he noted. But he also mused on the significance that all appeared to come from “highly intelligent parents”, very few of whom he considered “really warm-hearted”. For the best part, Kanner added, the closest relatives were “persons strongly preoccupied with abstractions of scientific, literary or artistic nature” and “limited in genuine interest in people”. Three of the marriages he declared “dismal failures”.While Kanner had hit on autism’s developmental roots, his remarks about parents fuelled damaging assertions that it was caused by “refrigerator mothers”. It led some psychiatrists to recommend “parentectomy”, a word as brutal as it sounds, with children physically removed from their families.Claims that autism was due to parenting were knocked down in the 1970s. Susan Folstein and Michael Rutter at King’s College London recruited twins where one or both had autism. After interviewing the parents and assessing the children, they wrote one of the most important papers in the field, demonstrating for the first time that autism was largely genetic. Soon after, Lorna Wing and Judith Gould, also at King’s, described an “autism spectrum” after finding a large group of children who didn’t fit Kanner’s narrow definition but displayed repetitive behaviours and had difficulties with social interactions, communication and imagination.Physicians as far back as the 18th century described various disorders of attention, but today’s understanding of ADHD, which brings inattention and hyperactivity into one diagnosis, was not defined until the 1980s. Doctors look for a persistent pattern of behaviours present before the age of 12 which “interfere with functioning or development”, from having difficulty focusing and acting impulsively to struggling to remain seated when expected.Studies suggest that some areas of the brain are smaller in ADHD while others are larger; that people have an imbalance in neurotransmitters; and there is greater connectivity between frontal brain regions, which handle attention and control, and deeper structures linked to learning, movement, rewards and emotion.There’s rarely an identifiable cause of autism or ADHD in a particular individual. Researchers are investigating links between autism and having older parents, a problematic birth and infections in pregnancy. For ADHD, questions are being asked about lead exposure, drinking and smoking in pregnancy, premature birth and brain injury.Scientists suspect DNA underpins up to 80% of autism and ADHD. While some genetic variants involved are rare and contribute substantially, many more, possibly thousands, will be common and have individually minor effects. These are scattered through the population and come together to different extents in different people, ultimately leading to a diagnosis in some but not others.For many scientists, understanding the biology of autism, ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions means teasing apart the genetics. Autism studies have already highlighted genetic variants that affect neurons and how they communicate. But the research is moving slowly, in part because it can be controversial. Some fear the discovery of gene variants linked to autism will lead to embryo screening and prenatal tests that remove autistic people from society, similar to what happened with Down’s syndrome. Another fear is that doctors may one day seek to prevent, or “cure”, autism through gene editing. As the Autistic Self Advocacy Network stated in 2022: “we do not want “cures” for autism. We want to continue being autistic.”Genetic variants can affect neurons and how they communicate. Photograph: koto_feja/Getty ImagesMorgan James Morgan, a PhD student at the University of Surrey, studies the genetics of autism. He is autistic and has an autistic daughter. “I understand why people are concerned,” he says. “Those concerns are legitimate, but I’m not sure that should stop us doing this whole area of research when it’s clearly so important to understanding what’s going on.”Morgan says part of his research aims to understand why autism is so varied. “One autistic person can be extremely different from another,” he says. “You could just help people based on what they present with, but it must help to understand why one person is different from another, and it looks like a lot of that is genetically driven.”It’s not the only area of contention. Some worry that the social model of disability sidelines neurodivergent people who have clear medical needs. “There are groups of parents who feel very left behind because their children are so different from the people who are forerunners of the neurodiversity movement,” says Professor Patricia Howlin, a founding editor of the journal Autism. Up to 30% of autistic people are non-speaking. Some experience epileptic seizures. Others will be fed by a tube directly into their stomach.“It goes back to the spectrum idea,” says Howlin. “There are autistic people who may be brilliant scientists or artists at one end of the spectrum, and at the other end there are autistic people who need help with almost all their daily activities. There are people who are highly sensitised to anything that suggests you might intervene or treat, whereas others, especially families or carers, say we desperately need intervention and treatment.”Proper support in education is essential, Happé says. If a teacher doesn’t know a child is autistic, the child might come across as rude when they are just being “autistically direct”. Clear information about changes in activities helps, as do visual schedules, timers that ensure transitions aren’t as jarring, and knowing children’s sensitivities. “Most of the things that work for autistic children are good for all children,” Happé adds.Improving the environment is key for ADHD too, says Dr Max Davie, a consultant paediatrician in London who has an ADHD diagnosis and is a trustee of ADHD UK. He uses the analogy of a “hungry brain” that is chronically under-stimulated. People need to understand ADHD and know how to respond to it, he says. Building positive relationships is crucial: if a child is crashing around the house, threatening to take away their Xbox could be counter-productive, pushing the relationship on to a confrontational footing. Good brain health is important too, he adds. “Make sure you are sleeping well, that your mood is under control, and get plenty of exercise. It makes your brain healthy and you’ll be better able to cope with your ADHD.”Autism and ADHD are separate conditions but there is an overlap in the underlying biology, who is diagnosed, the behaviours that manifest, and the care and support that works. Modifying the environment to make it as comfortable as possible is key for both but this is only part of it. “It is also about modifying the attitudes around you,” says Davie. “What helps is people who understand you and can structure and adapt to your needs.”Where to get helpIf you are affected by any of these issues and need support, please refer to:ADHD UK adhduk.co.ukADDitude additudemag.comNational Autism Society autism.org.ukAutistica autistica.org.ukADHD Foundation Australia adhdfoundation.org.auADHD Australia adhdaustralia.org.au"}

I had spent years preparing for this moment, and yet when it came, I felt only dread at the thought of freshers’ week and all the social challenges this would inevitably involve.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.I had always been something of a shrinking violet and the fact that I now had a close group of friends at school did not helped to assuagemy social anxiety. I assumed this was a stroke of extreme good luck – a one-off. The potential for rejection seemed immense, and I feared I would spend the next few years in loneliness.I was wrong: I soon made new friends. Yet my shyness lingered as I embarked on my career in journalism – a bizarre choice, I admit, for someone who felt nervous meeting strangers and loathed the idea of networking. I found ways to deal with those challenges, but it was only within the past few years that I began to truly relish the chance to meet new people.If only I had known then what I know now, my path might have been so much easier. As a science writer, I’ve witnessed a wealth of new research that has identified the psychological barriers that prevent us from building better relationships. Fortunately, my deep dive into the academic literature has also identified practical ways to build social confidence.I would turn down party invitations from people I admired, on the assumption they had only asked me out of politeness.Consider a phenomenon known as the liking gap, which describes our tendency to underestimate how much others have enjoyed our company and wish to build a stronger connection with us.In a series of experiments, psychologists asked two strangers to meet and chat and then questioned each party about their expectations and perceptions of the conversation. Before speaking, both assumed that the exchange would feel uncomfortable – yet they ended up enjoying it far more than they had believed they would. Over countless trials in all kinds of contexts, most people found it far easier to talk to strangers than they had initially feared.If only that pleasure was combined with self-confidence. After a conversation, most people assume they liked the other person more than the other person liked them. Or framed another way: neither party realise quite how appealing they have been and they don’t have faith the other person would be interested in building on that rapport with a future friendship.The liking gap can linger for months. One study asked university roommates to report on their perceptions of each other during their first year of living together. On average, it took each student about nine months for them to overcome their self-doubt and correctly appreciate how much the other person liked them.When I first learned about this research, I couldn’t help but cringe at all the times I had been afflicted by the liking gap. After meeting charming, funny and kind people, whom I wanted to get to know better, I would doubt that this was reciprocated. As a result, I would avoid any further contact for fear that I might seem embarrassingly needy. I would even turn down party invitations from people who I genuinely appreciated and admired, on the assumption they had only asked me out of politeness.Digging into the scientific literature, I soon found examples of many other misplaced fears that stand in the way of deeper and more meaningful relationships. Many of us are too shy about giving compliments or expressing our gratitude for other’s actions, for instance. We assume that they already know how great they are and we doubt our abilities to express those compliments elegantly. We imagine our gestures will seem ham-fisted and gauche.Those worries are largely unjustified. Most people are perfectly capable of distinguishing genuine praise from flattery and we consistently underestimate how much joy our words will bring. Provided that we display sensitivity and common sense, then our genuine appreciation will be welcomed for what it is – a small act of kindness.Expressing appreciation of others not only brings joy to the person receiving the praise but also to the person saying it; most people feel much better for having spoken their warm feelings. Unfortunately, our natural reserve means that most of us miss out on these opportunities to cement our bonds.We have similarly misplaced intuitions about self-disclosure – we tend to hold back our intimate thoughts and feelings and instead engage in superficial small talk when people tend to be far more interested in our inner life than we’d expect. This is a shame since that knowledge would be the foundation for a deeper relationship. And when we need help, we believe that people will resent us for our requests, when scientific research shows that they can enhance closeness, by proving our regard for the other person.Whether we regularly feel lonely, fear walking into a party full of strangers, or wish to get along better with our colleagues, most of us could do with a bit more faith in our social skills.Based on my own experiences and the research I have read, I believe this is imperative for anyone who wishes to live well. Feeling socially connected not only brings great joy, it also soothes our stress responses, thereby reducing our risk of many different illnesses – from the common cold to cardiac arrest. The results from more than 100 studies all show that social connection is as important for our health as diet or exercise. Greater connection can also enhance our creativity. The more nodes we have in our social network, the more exposed we will be to fresh ideas and new sources of inspiration.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionI have found that simply learning about concepts such as the liking gap can help us conquer our shyness, but it also needs perseverance if the effects are to last. As you will have found when learning any skill, greater confidence comes with regular practice outside our usual comfort zones.As my fluency in Italian increased, I was touched to see how my conversation partners saved me from embarrassment For me, an ambition to speak Italian gave me the necessary push. As my fluency in the language increased, I started arranging “conversation exchanges” with native speakers who wished to practise their English. Needless to say, I made many blunders, but I was touched to see how sensitively my conversation partners saved me from embarrassment and how easy it was to build a friendship despite the language barrier. Striking up new conversations in my native language suddenly felt a lot less daunting.You don’t need to go to this extreme. One study took the form of a week-long “scavenger hunt” that encouraged participants to set daily goals to approach and talk to strangers. They could decide to find someone with interesting shoes or eye-catching hair and then chat with them for a few minutes. Day by day, the participants came to recognise the pleasures of being more sociable and were less anxious about the possibility of rejection.We may still need strategies to help offset self-doubt when it kicks in. One tool that I use is “defocusing”, which involves making a conscious effort to look at the big picture instead of getting hung up on small details. If we think we have made a faux pas, we can remind ourselves of the many other things that we exchanged during the conversation; the other person’s impression of us is unlikely to hinge on a single clumsy comment, which will probably be forgotten. We might also remind ourselves of previous instances in which we’ve instantly jumped to the worst conclusion, but later found our fears were not proven.One of the best things you can do to overcome your shyness is to treat yourself with greater compassion. Many of us believe that self-criticism is essential if we are to behave better in the future, but the scientific literature suggests the very opposite is true. Beating ourselves up over a potential embarrassment only adds to our stress and reduces our capacity to learn from the perceived mistake. A simple exercise is to imagine that you are encouraging a friend or family member who is facing the same challenge or feeling the same worries; you might even write it down in the form as a letter. Once you have expressed those sentiments, you may find it far easier to be kinder to yourself.At the height of my shyness, it would have seemed inconceivable that I would write a book about social connection – let alone support it with public talks and media interviews. I don’t regret those years of anxiety; when considering the past, my overwhelming emotion is one of gratitude to all the people who proved my fears of rejection to be false. But I do wish that I could go back in time and tell my 18-year-old self about what I had learned. With just a little bit of encouragement and practice, we all have enormous potential to connect.The Laws of Connection: 13 Social Strategies That Will Transform Your Life by David Robson is published by Canongate on 6 June at £18.99.

It infects our view of ourselves; it complicates and confuses our view of the rest of the world; it stops us from fully understanding how the rest of the world relates to us.”Olusoga said the attitude “infects” Britain’s institutions and was one of the reasons why there were debates over the honours system. “It’s just silly to have national honours named after an empire that doesn’t exist. It’s like having it named after Narnia,” he said.Asked if he had an OBE, Olusoga said: “I have, yeah, and it’s utterly silly.”Britain had not dealt with or been “open and honest” about its history, which led to such “ridiculous contradictions”, he said.At the same event, Sathnam Sanghera, the author of Empireland and Empireworld, said that for him the British empire “did end with Hong Kong [in] 1997”.skip past newsletter promotionOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Isn’t that deeply shameful? And it continues.”Britain had never had a “dark night of the soul”, said Sanghera, “where we’ve had to reflect about what we did”.Olusoga noted that Britain did not have an empire museum, and Sanghera said the Victoria and Albert Museum would be a “brilliant basis” for such a museum because of its historical links to the East India Company.In 1879, about 19,000 objects given to, bought or looted by the East India Company for the India Museum in London were transferred to the South Kensington Museum, the predecessor of the V&A.Sanghera said the online abuse targeted at the writers was “not fair. We’re just writing history books.”Olusoga added that “shoot the messenger” attitudes had emerged because it was easier to accuse historians of “hating Britain” than to examine the history. “I’m accused of hating white people, which is bad news for my mother and my wife,” he said.Sanghera said one of the “common motifs” in the rightwing press was that American racism was worse than British racism, which was considered “twee and cute”, despite the fact that Britain “played a huge role in the development of racism”."}

A three-person cleanup crew ultimately spent six hours picking up the trash around the lake. Nevertheless, not all the trash was removed.Due to rocky beaches, high water levels and dangerous water conditions, cleanup crews will not be able to pick up the trash at the bottom of the lake “until late next month or early July”, said Carlisi.“What was left behind in the lake could be damaging to our fish and wildlife, which is a big problem. If a deer goes down to the water and eats a plastic wrapper, that would make them sick,” she added.In response to the litter, the University of Oregon issued a statement in which it apologized for its students’ actions.“The garbage left behind does not represent the values of our institution. We are sorry for the impact to the island and extra work for the forest service,” the statement said, KGW 8 reports.“We are investigating this event and working with the US Forest Service and our students to remediate the damage and hopefully prevent similar actions in the future. This is not a university sanctioned or sponsored event but is attended by university students, many of whom are members of university-recognized fraternities and sororities,” the university added.Similarly, the University of California, Davis announced that it was investigating the incident, saying, “The university was disappointed to learn of this conduct, and is exploring ways of working with students to help restore the site or otherwise address the situation. We are still assessing information from the forest service.“Students are expected to comply with all laws, and failure to do so may result in discipline under the university policy on student conduct. Student visits to Shasta Lake over Memorial Day weekend are not sanctioned or sponsored by the university,” it continued.The Guardian has reached out to the forest service for comment."}

Taiwan and our partnership has created the world’s AI infrastructure.”A day before his speech, Huang threw the opening pitch before a baseball game in Taipei. And on Thursday, he dined with some of Taiwan’s tech industry leaders, including the head of Foxconn.Lisa Su of AMD and the Qualcomm boss Cristiano Amon are also scheduled to deliver keynote speeches at Computex.Su is expected to outline AMD’s plans to compete in cutting-edge AI, while Amon will “showcase the AI-accelerated experiences users can expect from their next-generation PCs”, according to the organisers.Intel’s chief executive, Pat Gelsinger, and Rene Haas, head of the British chip design giant Arm, will also speak at the event.Tech firms are betting big on AI, and Taiwanese manufacturers are central to their plans – the island produces the bulk of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, including those needed for the most powerful AI applications and research.Suppliers such as Foxconn, traditionally focused on contract electronics for the likes of Apple, have also pivoted in recent years into producing AI hardware.Foxconn’s chief executive, Young Liu, told shareholders on Friday that the firm’s global market share for AI servers would increase to 40% this year.However, Taiwan’s central position in the supply chain for semiconductors – the lifeblood of the modern economy – has become a source of concern in capitals and boardrooms around the world.Taiwan is self-ruled, but China claims the island as its territory and has never ruled out the use of force to bring it under its control.In recent years, the relationship between Beijing and Taipei has deteriorated and the Chinese military has staged multiple large-scale exercises around the island – including the simulation of a blockade."}

Now, almost a decade since its launch, it attracts up to 80,000 monthly visitors.When she first moved to Birmingham, she was working as a health professional and updating her house in her spare time. The family has now been there for eight years, but prior to this Medina and her husband had lived in seven rental properties. “When we first moved in, we spoke to the landlord and told him we were looking for something long-term as we’d already had our first son,” she explains. “We wanted to decorate and he was quite open to that.”High society: the airy kitchen with plenty of space for cooking utensils. Photograph: Kasia Fiszer/The ObserverMedina’s 1950s house didn’t have feature fireplaces or period character, so they’ve added their own. “In my living room, we created built-in bookcases, which has made a big impact on the space. It looks so much nicer,” she says. “I would blog about these types of updates, because it was a way to relax and it felt therapeutic after having worked on something serious like a surgery.”Once Medina, 35, started posting about her home-improvement projects on social media, she realised a lot of people of the same age were in similar positions and her content was highly relatable. “I know how to navigate different types of landlords as I’ve had so many,” she explains. “I’ve been in situations where I’ve decorated the house and I’ve had to move out a couple of months later.”‘I started to blog because it felt therapeutic’: renovation expert and blogger Medina Grillo at home. Photograph: Kasia Fiszer/The ObserverAs you enter her current home there’s a small porch and here she has applied her creativity using Ikea hacks for shelves to display art; there is even an unconventional floor covering. “We initially laid wallpaper and put a sealant over it,” she explains. “That held up for about three or four years. I then added linoleum on top of it instead, which is what we still have now.”As more of us were restricted to our homes during the pandemic in 2020, being comfortable in that space grew in importance. When Medina started her Instagram account, @grillodesigns, it was unusual to see rental homes used as interior-design inspiration. “I found that some people feel that being a renter means they’re somehow not as successful as a person who owns,” she explains, “or because you rent you can’t have a nice home.” Medina wants to help these people overcome this belief. “I think it’s really important to talk about renting in a way where you can have and buy nice things for your home, within your own limits.”Having children didn’t stop Medina and her husband from doing this. They had a four-year old – now 11 – when they moved in, and they now have a two-year-old, too. “We did a lot of DIY when our eldest was very little and he got quite used to it,” she says. “He’d try to join us or take part as best as he could and I think that’s important – when you have kids, make them feel included and their spaces will feel more like home.”In the hallway, Medina painted numbers on the stair risers using a stencil. At the time her son was obsessed with numbers, so they incorporated them in their interior design. “We would always count the stairs when going up.”In her own bedroom, before she had her second child, she had dark walls. “After having my youngest, I just felt like I wanted a space that was a bit different and a bit more uplifting, and peaceful and calm at the same time,” she says. “I changed it again recently – we installed new wardrobe doors and painted the whole room back to white with the ceiling coloured in Crown Paints’ Overjoyed to kind of make it feel more fresh.” Carefully chosen accessories – curtains, cushions and a green throw from Dunelm – bring the look together.Although she’s moved around a lot, making spaces special and comfortable has always been important. It is something her own mother did when Medina was a child. “I want to pass this to my children, because when you’re a child you don’t know whether your house is rented or owned. It’s not really a big deal to you at all. You just want to come home to a place where you feel safe.”In 2019, Medina wrote Home Sweet Rented Home about her experiences as a renter and featuring advice on DIY in rental properties. “I’ve had landlords that weren’t really great with keeping on top of home updates and I’ve had to move as a result of that,” she says. “So I’ve really had it all over the years. I know what to do and what not to do.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionAnd so to bed: carefully chosen accessories, like the curtains, cushions and a green throw from Dunelm, bring the look together. Photograph: Kasia Fiszer/The ObserverHoming instincts: Medina Grillo’s top tips for high-impact decorating in a rental Decorate in ways that won’t damage the walls. For instance, you can use temporary wallpaper that can be removed. If you are not allowed to paint, add interest with temporary touches, such as stickers. Inject personality using accessories – try a feature rug or some bright coloured cushions. Get the children involved and ask for their input when it comes to making decisions, especially in their own bedrooms. If you can’t hang works of art, place them on freestanding shelving systems. ‘I think that art is the best way to inject colour into any space.’ Talk to your landlord and see whether they’d be willing to contribute financially to long-term home improvements. It’s important to think about our impact on the world and not be constantly changing things and buying new items. ‘We need to decorate in a way that we know will last a long time.’grillo-designs.com"}

Magnet fishing simply involves putting a rope with a strong magnet on it into water with the hopes of retrieving metal objects.No one expected a safe to be on the end of the line though. Let alone one stuffed with cash.“We pulled out and it was two stacks of freaking hundreds,” said Kane.The couple said they contacted the New York police department about the find and said they were told there was no crime attached to the cash and there was no way to identify the original owner of the safe, meaning they were allowed to keep it.“I couldn’t believe it,” said Agostini. “I lost it.”The couple said they’ve never found anything like this, citing some of their previous finds, including old guns, World War II grenades, a full-sized motorcycle, foreign coins, and jewellery."}

That bit is easy – the top line, and quite divorced from me.”It’s Friday lunchtime in her literary agent’s airy West End office. A copy of her new memoir, These Heavy Black Bones, sits on the table between us. It documents the dedication demanded of a young athlete; the sacrifice and strain that comes with competing at the highest of levels. It’s vulnerable and exposing. She’s 30 now. Half her lifetime ago, at the age of 15, Ajulu-Bushell was ranked as the top short-course 50m female breaststroker internationally, of any age. In the run up to London 2012, aged 17, at what should have been the pinnacle of her swimming career, Ajulu-Bushell walked away from her sport, never to return. She writes of the toll it took to be the first; the cost of chasing peak performance. “Speaking about the detail feels more like shaky ground,” she says, tentatively. “I’m still not sure I feel ready. Part of me just wants to run away.”For most of the intervening years, she resolved not to return to these sporting experiences. “Then Covid happened and everyone felt the world was ending. You revisited things. And I was in the midwest of America at the time working on a PhD, which I never finished. George Floyd was murdered, not that far away. The Black Lives Matter movement reemerged. Alice Dearing had just qualified for the Tokyo 2021 – the first Black woman to swim for TeamGB at an Olympic Games. It had been 10 years since I stopped. Articles were written that talked about me: that I was going to be the first before I quit the Olympic team. My name being in the press again was a reminder of something I’d put behind me.”Ajulu-Bushell did a TV interview with Sky Sports that same year, for Black History month. “I talked about how racism still exists in all sports at elite level and in mine specifically.” Soon, she began writing. “I’ve always wanted to write,” she says, “and this felt the place to start.” A novel in the works already, long term, she hopes to write fiction. “First I wanted to suck the poison out, to see if I could.”From an early age, the signs of Ajulu-Bushell’s future success were there. “Swimming always felt easier than walking,” she says. “At school in Nairobi – I would have been six – I had this great swimming teacher. She wrote in my reports: ‘Rebecca will be a swimming star of the future.’” Her first competition was a small inter-school gala. She won every race she entered. “I went home and drew a picture of a little brown girl in a swimming costume with a comically large gold medal around her neck. ‘Mum,’ I said, ‘this is me when I win the Olympics.’”‘They were always watching us’: Rebecca Achieng Ajulu-Bushell. Photograph: Kate Peters/The ObserverBorn in Warrington, it was in Nairobi that Ajulu-Bushell spent the longest stretch of her childhood. Her mother and stepfather were humanitarian aid workers, which meant regular relocation. There were stints in Uganda, Malawi and South Africa, alongside the Kenyan capital. When she was 10, the family landed in Cape Town. “I had these two crazy Eastern Bloc coaches,” she says, “and much more resources than in Kenya. The swimming stepped up, hugely. It becomes your whole life overnight. The hours-in are astounding. You need these hours in a pool to train your body to develop in a certain way. No one sits you down to sign away your childhood. Suddenly, you’re in a world where the intensity and sacrifice are normalised entirely.”When Ajulu-Bushell was 13, her parents planned a return to Nairobi. “I couldn’t keep my training up there,” she says, “and my parents realised their lives couldn’t fit five more years of my schedule. I was sent to a boarding school in Plymouth. There are lots of sports schools in the UK, set up to create mini high-performance centres for children. I was on this really intense swimming programme.” About 24 children, aged 13-18, lived and trained together. “My childhood was in East and South Africa,” she says. “I was barefoot, climbing trees with no makeup. Then I arrived in Devon, 2007. The culture shock? It was insane.” Then came the swimming.The daily routine: alarms went off at 4.45 every morning. In the pool from 5:15am, they’d swim for two and a half hours. “We’d do 8 to 10km,” she explains, “before heading to school for breakfast. We’d eat as much as possible. We were burning so many calories that we were starving, all the time.” After a day spent in classes with the wider year group, they returned, again, to training. “Another two-hour session. Then dinner at school, an hour of weights and gym training, before going back to the boarding house for homework, packing and unpacking, endless costume drying. By the time you were done, it was past 11pm. Then at 4.45am you’d start it all again.”And if you fancied a lie in?“No no no,” she interrupts. “That doesn’t happen. You never miss training. Never. If you did miss the morning, you weren’t allowed to train in the evening. It sounds like a reverse punishment, but that’s what we feared. I don’t know if this is real, but it felt like it at the time: every session out of the pool, you lose feel for the water. You’re looking for 0.4 of a second gain on your time: the difference between winning and coming fourth. Every second counts.”‘Swimming felt easier than walking’: at the age of five in Kenya. Photograph: Courtesy of Achieng Ajulu-BushellOf all the sessions Ajulu-Bushell vividly describes, one sticks out specifically. “I was 13 or 14 when I was training and my knee, I think, came out of its socket. It hurt like hell.” She dragged herself to the water’s edge in silence. “In the same way we don’t miss training, the idea of getting an injury was horrifying. I sat on the side of the pool and pushed my knee back into the socket. In hindsight, it’s quite mad.” Pushing to these extremes, she feels, wasn’t unique to her experience.“It’s more than an open secret,” she says. “It’s almost an expectation. A lot of people I know swam through horrific injuries and eating disorders. We would train until we threw up. Then we’d get back in and carry on. And a lot of the hardcore stuff was, if not celebrated, then made light of. As kids, we found ways to make it normal.” How intended all this is, she suggests, is up for debate. “But the way you train isn’t just designed to challenge your body. It’s designed to mould your mind. Not just to give you an acceptance of discomfort, but to make you, almost, like it.” This was the mid-2000s. “It’s not that long ago. And even in the years since, I’m not sure how much elite sport has changed in what it expects from child athletes.”This pressurised culture wasn’t confined to the pool. “Food cupboards were locked in the kitchen so we couldn’t get at it – a lot of hyper-vigilance around food, especially as the girls got older. I didn’t start my period until I was 16, because my body fat levels were so low. Half naked on the poolside, a constant interrogation of your body; weighed on scales, tested for fat levels in front of your peers, what you’re eating watched every day. I won’t say it was normal, but it wasn’t specific to where I was training.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionWe’d train till we threw up, then get back in and carry on. In the kitchen, food was locked awayShe writes of having her privacy and autonomy stripped through this period of adolescence. In the world of young elite athletes, she says, “There’s a lot of bullying. It’s definitely used as a training tactic in some places. Elsewhere, it’s just designed to humiliate. We put our bodies through an awful lot of trauma.” She was 14 when she started weight training. The result? “I’m relatively short, have flat feet, and still wake up in the middle of the night with phantom pains shooting from my hips down to my knees. Listening to coaches screaming at swimmers was normal. At the end of the first chapter, I write about a coach commenting on how our costumes don’t shrink after returning from the summer holidays. For young women that stuff can be very traumatic – and it happened regularly.”Alongside this intense training regime, Ajulu-Bushell was dealing with another strain: more often than not, she was the only person of colour in these spaces. “My mum is white. My dad was Black Kenyan. I’d grown up in Africa, with Blackness all around me. It wasn’t, therefore, particularly interrogated.” Then she arrived in Devon. “I write a lot in the book about not understanding or wanting to accept my relationship with Blackness in the very white world around me.”Context here is key. “It’s not true,” she says, “that Black people can’t or don’t swim, but that’s a prevailing mythology. There’s pseudoscience: that our bones are heavier; that we can’t float; that our muscle density is higher. Then there’s generational and cultural trauma in the Black community around swimming and water safety. There’s a history of Black bodies drowning in the Atlantic through the slave trade.” But she was raised across the African continent. “I grew up swimming with Black and brown people in Kenya and South Africa, so that never really rang true to me. And I was also pretty good myself.”As her rankings climbed, and Olympic promise grew, journalists became interested in this frontier-breaking narrative. “I’m so proud of my Black identity now,” she says, “but I never felt that at the time. It came with micro-aggressions, comments and ignorance; those small ways children are racist to the person who is different all the time. Nothing I hold against any of them; what was in the press was far more punishable. One article at the time said: ‘She speaks with a cut-glass British accent.’ I didn’t want to be known as the Black swimmer. I wanted to be the best swimmer. Which I was, for a while. In spite of being Black.”No single event made Ajulu-Bushell hang up her towel. “There’s no crescendo moment. I just wanted it all to stop. I wanted silence. No more press. Nobody looking at my developing body. I wanted it all to go away.” The 2010 Commonwealth Games hadn’t gone to plan; she’d placed last in her 100m event. “I come back,” she says, “and I’m so tired of all the stakeholders in my success. My body feels like a vessel through which everyone else will realise their dreams.” There’d been talk of her dropping out of school to swim full-time. Academia, like everything beyond swimming, had long taken a back seat: on the eve of her sitting her GCSE exams, reporters had been invited into the school to interview the swimmers. “And what if I did drop out of school and mess up my A-levels? Whether or not I made the podium, I decided it wasn’t worth it. I quit.”‘We’d do 8 to 10km before breakfast. We were starving all the time’: winning gold as an 11-year-old. Photograph: Courtesy of Achieng Ajulu-BushellSo her future took a different path. Studying fine art at Brasenose College, Oxford. Post-graduation, she spent time in Paris. She made films, worked in comms and started that PhD, before taking on her current job – chief executive of the 10,000 Interns Foundation, tasked with transforming workplaces for underrepresented talent.One detail, I say, stood out when I read her book. How, despite being part of a wider school community, there was a swimmer-specific boarding house – on a different site – where she and the other young athletes lived separately. “It kept us away,” she says, “from the normality of adolescence and teenage-hood. I call it a panopticon – they were always watching us. When you start to deliberately draw parameters around a group, isolating them from their peers, it’s how you can really start shaping and influencing their lives. How much control can be exerted over their existence. At that age, your schema is yet to fully develop. Put a kid into that system really young and tell them this is what to do, after a few years that’s all they know. Maybe that’s the structure that’s needed. The magic ingredients to make the best elite athletes; blinkers that disincentive you from looking at anything peripheral beyond your lane.” Are the results worth it?She compares it to the ethics of the entertainment industry’s creation of often ill-fated child stars. “That same lens hasn’t been brought to professional sport,” she believes, “because there’s a perceived purity around sport, which stops it blending with that Hollywood conversation. There isn’t money being exchanged in the same way, it’s not seen as work. Kids are amateur athletes. And that’s true, until you take sponsorship. But it’s an investment nonetheless. There are those same stories. Tragic endings for ex-young athletes. Nobody wants to corrupt or pollute the world of sport with these complicated questions.”With just months before the Paris Olympic Games begins, wider discussions about the human cost of elite sports are once again emerging. Before I even ask the question, Ajulu-Bushell knows what’s coming. “One of the reasons I didn’t write about all these experiences for so long,” she says, “is because I thought, if I did, I needed an answer to that. It’s like when I was 16 and was asked, constantly: ‘What do we do to get Black people to swim?’ I was like, ‘I’m a child, I don’t fucking know.’”‘It kept us away from the normality of adolescence and teenage-hood’: at the British Championships in Sheffield, aged 16. Photograph: Courtesy of Achieng Ajulu-Bushell“We need to keep pushing for reform, and checks and balances, in these spaces,” she says. “Are we going to do away with elite sport? No, it’s too powerful. I don’t want us to. The Olympics is this incredible bastion of resistance and humanity. I don’t think the human race will stop trying to push beyond the boundaries and records set generations before us. But surely we can find safer ways to do it. The media has to answer for the pressure it puts on young athletes. Safeguarding institutions within sport need reform.”There’d been talk of our photoshoot taking place at the Aquatics Centre in east London’s Olympic Park, home of the 2012 games. Ajulu-Bushell declined; she’s still never been, despite now living in its vicinity. She doesn’t swim today. “No, never,” she says. “On holiday, maybe, but I don’t get in the pool. There’s no reason to. Plus, it’s quite antisocial to go to public swimming sessions and swim really, really fast.”“And swimming was an addiction,” she says, “a perfect high. When I quit, what I was most scared of was not getting that feeling again. So lots of these bizarre sacrifices, or things that feel sinister. It’s in the context of this prize that was like ecstasy. It’s a tension. It felt heartbreaking to write down so much of what’s in the book.” She looks down at my copy, still conflicted, “because even now I’d do it all again for that high, in all honesty.”These Heavy Black Bones by Rebecca Achieng Ajulu-Bushell is published on 6 June by Canongate at £18.99"}

Hate, online bullying or photos sent to her house circling her face with red Biro like a target had been unsettling, but not uncommon. This was different.Jones lost 50 pounds, took medical leave from work and watched in disbelief as chunks of her hair started to fall out. Knowing something had to change in the spring of 2023, she filed a lawsuit and wrote her book.That Librarian: The Fight Against Book Banning in America is Jones’s debut memoir, which will be released later this summer. It tells the story of her fight against censorship in the small town she was raised in and of the rise in attacks on librarians and intellectual freedom across the US.“I cried a lot, then decided to fight back,” Jones said. “I hope librarians can read my book and feel like they’re not alone.”Jones’s story made international headlines when she became one of the first librarians in the US to file a lawsuit for defamation against those who launched personal attacks on her after she spoke out at a public library board meeting. In July of 2022, when book banning started affecting Livingston parish, where she lived and worked, Jones made a speech against literary censorship at her local public library board. A targeted attacks began shortly thereafter.“One man posted a picture of me online asking parents how they’d feel if I was giving their kids pornography,” Jones said. “Another made a meme saying I advocate teaching 11-year-olds about anal sex.”The two men behind these posts and attacks, Michael Lunsford and Ryan Thames, were the focus of the ensuing legal battle.“All I did was give a delicate speech on censorship,” she said. “They started posting pages from books I didn’t reference, hadn’t heard of. Awful things spread like wildfire about me around my community.”Across the country, book banning has been rising at an alarming rate. PEN America documented more than 10,000 bans between 2021 and 2023. Increasingly, school districts or local libraries and their workers are becoming the target of conservative activists and parents.The individuals leveling these bans demand that books with sexual references, themesor discussions of racial conflict be removed from school or public shelves. Frequently, they single out authors of color or those who identify as LGBTQ+.True power, though, is the ability to live rent-free in someone else’s head when you don’t think about them at allWhen Jones first went public with her story, hundreds of other state librarians reached out to describe similar experiences or battles. She decided to join professional boards, conference panels and associations like the American Library Association to speak out about the hate they faced. In 2023, Oprah Winfrey even praised Jones’s work at the National Book Awards.“The people that harassed me, they still post about me all the time, sometimes five times a day,” Jones said, before adding: “True power, though, is the ability to live rent-free in someone else’s head when you don’t think about them at all.” She credits this as her favorite line in the book.Conservative activists continually refer to the people who defend books as “groomers”, using rhetoric like “pedophiles” and “child molesters” in their public outcries. Saving the children has become an unfounded, underlying justification for this wave of attacks, which are not just aimed at school librarians but drag storytellers, liberal politicians and authors across the country.The Proud Boys, a regularly violent US extremist group, have been known to attack or protest outside LGBTQ+ themed events at multiple libraries, with instances happening in San Lorenzo, California and New York City.Often, librarians are caught in the middle of these campaigns or hostilities and left to defend their institutions in highly volatile situations. Suzette Baker lost her job as a librarian in Llano county, Texas, in 2022 after she refused to put a copy of Critical Race Theory behind the counter. It’s not just harassment or social media shaming at stake for people in this profession; their jobs and livelihoods are increasingly being put on the line.While Jones was able to turn her situation around and make a success of her experience with the upcoming book, the journey wasn’t easy. Hate still lingers in the community she grew up in and lives in, and she’s lost friends and acquaintances over the rumors that were spread about her.“One of the chapters is a play on Michelle Obama’s quote: when they go low, you go high,” Jones concluded.“When I wrote my story, I tried to go high. I hope that no one harasses the men who harassed me. I just wanted to be honest, truthful, diplomatic.”That Librarian: The Fight Against Book Banning in America will be published on 27 August."}

The picture is included in Robbie Lawrence’s Long Walk Home, a double volume of photographs that are the result of five years of travels in Scotland and Scottish outposts in the US in search of the true tartan spirit of Highland gatherings. “Every event I photographed,” Lawrence writes by way of introduction, “whether on a dusty sports field in Denver, or at the local park in Burntisland, is at its core a coming together of friends and family to enjoy sports, dance and music.”To begin with, on this quest, Lawrence hoped to strip away the myth-making, to look beneath the kilt of the games, to capture something like their authentic nature. He abandoned that idea, however. Instead, his pictures of grunting caber tossers and spry country dancers, and pipe bands emerging from dreich summer weather, became an attempt “to engage with the myriad of fabricated ideas surrounding the modern Highland Games”, the ways in which those rooted in glens by daily fact or inherited memory find joy in their Scottishness.The poet John Burnside provides an essay for the second book of Long Walk Home, alongside artful studio portraits of Games legends and hopefuls, lit like Old Masters. Burnside recalls his own version of the West Fife diaspora, relocated in 1965 to Corby New Town, evoking memories of childhood drums and bagpipes “that seemed to rise up out of the earth itself to claim me physically, spiritually… a call to something I did not need to understand”. Scottishness as presented at the Games may well be “as much myth as it is history” Burnside writes, but that only means “we must guard it carefully, retell it beautifully and, more than anything else, love it wisely”.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion"}

She grew up in Northampton, and after university worked as an academic. In 2002, she switched careers, as the director of Creative Partnerships, a government programme that aimed to develop creativity in young people by bringing schools and artists together. In 2006, she became the director of the Whitworth in Manchester, where she oversaw a building project that doubled its space; in 2011, she took on the role of director of Manchester City Galleries as well. In 2015, she was made a CBE. Her new book, Gathering of Strangers: Why Museums Matter, is based on the lectures she gave in 2022 at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge, when she was Slade professor of fine art.Did you change your mind about anything while you were working on this book?Yes. It helped me firm up my thoughts on things where our intention was good, but we didn’t get it right, like the Hogarth show [Hogarth and Europe, in 2022, widely criticised for its disapproving, culture wars tone]. We were too didactic, and we’ve learned from that. I’ve started to understand that the problem with the [museum] paradigm is that you’re supposed to be the authority. Actually, what’s more useful is not to be frightened of your expertise while also accepting that others will want different positions and views, too.You talk a lot about relevance. Isn’t art sometimes allowed just to be beautiful and life-enriching?I try not to use the word too much, but museums are tasked with telling history from a modern perspective. We’re shaping stories, and they can either be stories people care about or not. This doesn’t mean you have to lose all sense of joy or fun.Isn’t there an ever-present danger that galleries end up patronising the very visitors they most long to attract?When I first went to museums, I found them really intimidating. I look out of this window and I see the steps up to Tate Britain, and I know that historically they’re one of the greatest barriers to entry, because they’re so grand and they speak to a certain kind of cultural privilege. I don’t think you can just leave people to discover Titian. It’s incomprehensible. It’s art with big and difficult themes that tell you it’s important, but you’re not quite sure why.Emily Kam Kngwarray’s work is very political, and utterly beautiful. It will be the most important exhibition Tate has done for a long time In the book, you’re critical of the British Museum’s new £50m partnership with BP. Aren’t all museums in the same boat, and simply desperately in need of funds?I’ve never known a time when we weren’t concerned about funding; that’s a normal part of life as a museum director. Our numbers are not quite back up to where they were pre-pandemic; international tourism is going to take a couple more years to recover, and while local visitors are spending more, that’s against the absolute loss of reserves during Covid, and the effect of inflation on running costs. But the issue the BM faces in taking BP’s money is that the public has moved to a position where they think it is inappropriate, and there’s a dissonance between wishing to be seen as extremely sensitive in the way we relate to other cultures and careful about the resources we consume, and then taking money from a company that has not yet demonstrated whether it’s really committed to changing. The new director of the British Museum [Nicholas Cullinan, late of the National Portrait Gallery] is going to have to deal with a lot of public dismay.Tell me a bit more about your background, which you describe as working-class.My dad worked for Northampton borough council – he was head of parks – and my mum was a teacher. I was encouraged to read lots, and I was always taken to the theatre. But the Northampton Museum… I might have gone in once or twice – I was bequeathed a very old doll by my father’s grandmother, and we took it in for them to have a look – but I never really visited because it was not an art museum, and I was interested in art. This is probably grievously unfair but, in my memory, it was very much focused on shoes [Northamptonshire has a long history of shoe-making].Where were you when you heard you’d been made director of Tate? Did you expect to land the job?I wasn’t surprised, because you go through such an arduous process. I’d done three interviews. I knew it would be a hard job to get, but I also knew I had deep experience. In Manchester, I’d worked with collections very like the Tate’s. When I heard, I was in Hong Kong. The chair of the trustees rang me. I think he’d forgotten I was there because he called at 3.30 in the morning.‘Absolutely remarkable’: Cornelia Parker’s Cold Dark Matter. Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/ShutterstockWere you thrilled?I was thrilled, and then I was scared, and I think you stay scared. I still come into work feeling terrified. It takes you five or six years just to understand the institution.Is the museum world sexist?I think I’ve experienced the same amount of sexism as any woman in a leadership career. Our world certainly isn’t immune to sexism. Of 15 national museums, only two are run by women.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionYour clothes are fantastic. Where did you get your wonderful multicoloured coat?It’s by my friend Duro Olowu, the Nigerian-born British designer. He has a shop in Mason’s Yard [in London] but I can’t really afford him myself, so I got this – as I do all my best clothes – from Vestiare [the secondhand designer fashion site].What are you most excited about coming up?In 2025, there will be an Emily Kam Kngwarray exhibition at Tate Modern. She is the most important of the Aboriginal artists who’ve come to global prominence in the last couple of decades. Her extraordinary painting is known a little in this country, but we haven’t seen the best of her work, and her very large-scale abstracts have almost never travelled outside Australia. The work is very political, and utterly beautiful. It will be the most important exhibition Tate has done for a long time. I hope people will come from all over Europe for it, because you’ll never see these great works here again.And – predictable question! – what’s your favourite piece in the Tate’s collection?Cornelia Parker’s Cold Dark Matter [an exploded shed, its remnants suspended from the ceiling, made by the British artist in 1991]. It’s absolutely remarkable, full of explosive joy and impossibility. I worked with Connie in Manchester, and we did a Q&A with her, and someone in the audience asked about the explosion. They wanted to know if she’d rehearsed it, and what she would have done if it hadn’t worked. Well, you can’t rehearse an explosion. She said: “I think what I do is paint myself into a corner, and then jump.” So many of my own critical decisions have been made like that. I paint myself into a corner, and then jump."}

But he faces a tough challenge in his bid for a fourth mandate, after his mother joined a rival camp.Ingria, one of the smallest villages in Italy, is home to 46 inhabitants. A further 26 people, registered to vote from abroad, make up the electorate.De Santis, 42, has led the administration since 2009 and had expected competition in the mayoral race from an opposition councillor, 70-year-old Renato Poletto. The situation became more complicated when Stefano Venuti, a Milan resident who has a second home in Ingria, threw his hat into the ring. “We weren’t expecting that,” said De Santis.And then the micro-race was fully upended by Poletto announcing that he had secured the support of De Santis’s mother, Milena Crosasso, and had put her forward for a councillor position in the ballot to elect a new council on 8-9 June, as part of a list comprising nine women and one man. In all, 30 people – about two-thirds of the village’s inhabitants – are now competing for positions.“I did ask [my mother] to join me but after she saw that Poletto’s list was mostly women she decided to go with them,” said De Santis. “They are all volunteers who have worked really hard for the village.”Crosasso said that the rivalry would not impact family harmony. “Both my son and I want the best for the community and this is an opportunity to give voice to women’s points of view without weakening family bonds,” she said.Ingria is in Italy’s Soana Valley and experiences similar issues to other mountain villages, such as depopulation, scant services and challenges with snow during winter. Since 2022, when it was named as being among Italy’s “most beautiful” villages, it has also had to deal with an increase in tourism.“There has been an incredible spike and we have to manage this,” said De Santis. “There are few residents, but a lot of second homes.

The protection of women and girls’ spaces is too important to allow the confusion to continue.”Last year, Badenoch asked the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to advise on the change. The equalities watchdog said the new definition would make it possible to exclude trans people from same-sex spaces even if they hold a gender recognition certificate (GRC).Badenoch said on Sunday that she had concluded the law needed to be changed in order to provide protections based on biological sex, saying it was crucial to allow single-sex groups to meet without those of the opposite biological sex.The law will still protect against discrimination based on the status of gender reassignment, the Conservatives said.The party also said it would change the law to make gender recognition a reserved matter which only the UK government could legislate on, a reaction to the row over the Scottish gender recognition bill, which was blocked by Westminster.Announcing the change, Rishi Sunak said that he wanted to enshrine the right to single-sex spaces in law.“The safety of women and girls is too important to allow the current confusion around definitions of sex and gender to persist,” he said.“The Conservatives believe that making this change in law will enhance protections in a way that respects the privacy and dignity of everyone in society. We are taking an evidence-led approach to this issue so we can continue to build a secure future for everyone across the whole country.”skip past newsletter promotionOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We call it a light, flashy fuel because it is so fine. It’s very receptive to the fire,” Silveira said.Interstate 580, which connects the San Francisco Bay Area to San Joaquin county in central California, was closed in both directions from Corral Hollow Road to Interstate 5 due to the lack of visibility from the smoke, the California department of transportation said in a statement.Two Alameda county firefighters were injured, according to Alameda county public affairs manager Cheryl Hurd.In a statement on Saturday evening, Hurd said: “Two ACFD Firefighters suffered minor to moderate burn injuries,” adding that they have been transported to local hospitals, Patch reports.The San Joaquin county office of emergency services issued an evacuation order, pinpointing the wildfire in an area east of Interstate 580. Residents between Corral Hollow Road and Tracy Boulevard were ordered to leave their homes, with residents south of Tracy Boulevard told to be prepared for evacuation.An evacuation update included areas west of the California Aqueduct south of Corral Hollow Creek, west to Alameda county and south to Stanislaus county. A temporary evacuation point was established at Larch Clover community center in Tracy, the county emergency services office said on its website.In a statement on Twitter/X, Stockton’s mayor, Kevin J Lincoln, wrote: “Praying for our Tracy neighbors and first responders. The city of Stockton is providing mutual-aid to the city of Tracy covering a firehouse while they are fighting the Corral Fire.”The wildfire was near the Lawrence Livermore laboratory’s Site 300 south-west of Tracy, Cal Fire said in a social media post late Saturday.Lawrence Livermore is a research and development institution primarily focusing on the US nuclear weapons stockpile. Site 300, 15 miles (24km) east of the laboratory’s main installation, supports “development of explosive materials as well as hydrodynamic testing and diagnostics”, according to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory website.“Here, our researchers can safely formulate, fabricate, and test high-explosive assemblies to assess the performance of nonnuclear weapon prototypes and components,” the website says of Site 300.The wildfire presented no threats to any laboratory facilities or operations and the fire had moved away from the site, Lawrence Livermore spokesperson Paul Rhien said in a statement to the Associated Press early on Sunday.“We have been working in close partnership with Cal Fire, Alameda county Fire Dept, and other emergency services partners throughout the evening,” Rhien said. “As a precaution, we have activated our emergency operations center to monitor the situation through the weekend.”Meanwhile, the National Weather Service in Sacramento has issued an excessive heat watch starting from Tuesday morning and through Thursday evening. The heat watch spans areas including Carquinez strait and delta, Sacramento valley, Northeast Foothills, northern San Joaquin valley, and portions of Shasta county.In its warning, the NWS said that this level of heat “affects anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration”. It went on to urge residents to consider canceling outdoor activities during the heat of the day.The Associated Press contributed to this report"}
{"title": "Revealed: Russian legal foundation linked to Kremlin activities in Europe | Russia | The Guardian", "caption": "Exclusive: Leaked internal documents show Pravfond has spent millions of euros to finance propaganda and legal campaigns", "author": "Andrew Roth", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/02/revealed-russian-legal-defence-foundation-pravfond-europe", "text": "Leaked internal documents have exposed the activities of a Russian state-backed legal defence foundation that European intelligence agencies and analysts say is in fact a Kremlin influence operation active in 48 countries across Europe and around the world.Internal documents from the Fund for Support and Protection of the Rights of Compatriots Living Abroad (Pravfond) indicate that the foundation finances propaganda websites targeted at Europeans, helped pay for the legal defence of the convicted arms trafficker Viktor Bout and the assassin Vadim Krasikov, and has employed a number of former intelligence officers as the directors of its operations in European countries.The documents show that the group has spent millions of euros to finance propaganda and legal campaigns. Public data also shows that Pravfond’s local partners have received millions in state subsidies from a number of the European states where the foundation operates local branches, raising questions about the use of public funds and national security concerns just days before elections to the European parliament.More than 40 Pravfond documents, obtained by the Danish public broadcaster DR from a European intelligence source and shared with a consortium of European journalists including the Guardian, show that the organisation has had a number of documented former intelligence agents among its leadership. They include Vladimir Pozdorovkin, who has been identified by European intelligence sources as an agent for the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service, and in public records as Pravfond’s curator for its operations in the Nordic and Baltic countries; and Anatoly Sorokin, who the documents show is a member of the SVR and curates Pravfond’s Middle East, Moldova, and Transnistria division.The head of the Institute of the Russian Diaspora, which is listed on official documents as Pravfond’s “project implementer”, is Sergey Panteleyev, who has been subject to sanctions in EU countries as a member of a Russian military intelligence unit that specialises in psychological-warfare operations.Andrei Soldatov, an expert on the Russian intelligence services and co-author of The Compatriots, said Pravfond appeared to be a “classic soft-power effort” and that the ties between intelligence and compatriot organisations were “well documented”. He noted that Andrey Milyutin, the deputy head of the department of operative information of the fifth service of Russia’s security agency, the FSB, was a member of the government’s committee on “compatriots living abroad”, indicating the link between intelligence activity and outreach to the Russian diaspora.In a 2020 national security report, the Estonian security services called Pravfond a “pseudo legal protection system” that “in reality is an influence operations fund”, and they have said the FSB uses the groups to recruit collaborators abroad, including among supporters of the 2014 annexation of Crimea, many of whom had ties to the group.Pravfond was founded in 2012 by presidential decree and was backed by the Russian ministry of foreign affairs and the federal agency Rossotrudnichestvo, which administers foreign aid and has been described by the head of Pravfond, Alexander Udaltsov, as a “unique element of Russian soft power”. Udaltsov has been subject to sanctions by the European Union since 2023 for “supporting and implementing actions and policies which undermine and threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine”.Pravfond did not reply to questions sent by the Guardian and by its reporting partners in the week before this publication, although some of the recipients of its local grants did.The documents show that Pravfond sponsored the legal defence of Krasikov, an alleged FSB agent who was given a life sentence for the murder of the former Chechen field commander Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in Berlin’s Tiergarten in 2019. The documents indicate that the lawyer Robert Unger received €60,000 in legal fees paid out by Pravfond’s budget in 2021 as approved by Udaltsov. A European intelligence source said it possessed documents showing that Unger had received a larger sum of money for representing Krasikov in previous sessions, but could not provide documentation.Asked about the payments, Unger confirmed he had received a request from the journalist consortium but said his mandate for Krasikov ended in 2021 after the life sentence and that because he was “still subject to legal professional confidentiality even after the end of the mandate and have not been released from it, I am unfortunately prevented from answering your questions”.A Pravfond budget document from 2014 also showed that the organisation had provided significant sums to fund the legal defences of Bout and the convicted drug trafficker Konstantin Yaroshenko, both of whom later returned to Russia as part of prisoner exchanges negotiated between Moscow and Washington.The documents also indicated that Pravfond had spent hundreds of thousands of euros to maintain several websites that purported to fight against “Russophobia” and promote the “defence of the Russian language” in Europe. It has also funnelled money to a number of fringe publications throughout Europe.Documents obtained by the consortium showed that Pravfond funded the activities of golos.eu, an online portal that operates out of a post-office box in Brussels and mainly provides a vehicle for commentators to voice criticism of the Ukrainian government, particularly the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his top aides and military advisers.Reached for comment by the Guardian, the Golos deputy editor Yuri Andriychenko denied that the site received money from Pravfond or had any links to the Russian state. He suggested that someone else had applied for grant funding using the site’s name, writing: “We are not surprised that someone in Russia is trying to make money on our name, because it is much easier than creating your own project.”According to the internal documents, Pravfond also funds the activities of Euromore, another online portal that focuses heavily on purported threats to Russians in Europe. Euromore was “designed to take into account the closure of international platforms” such as RT and Sputnik by the EU authorities and “create its own significant alternative”, the documents said. Those sites were largely blacklisted in the west after the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022."}

The results were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the world’s largest cancer conference.The study was led by University College London, University College London hospital, the Christie NHS Foundation Trust in Manchester, St James’s University hospital in Leeds, University hospital Southampton and the University of Glasgow.Prof Mark Saunders, a consultant clinical oncologist at the Christie, said the trial results were “really very exciting”.“Immunotherapy prior to surgery could well become a ‘gamechanger’ for these patients with this type of cancer. Not only is the outcome better, but it saves patients from having more conventional chemotherapy, which often has more side-effects. In the future, immunotherapy may even replace the need for surgery.”Bowel cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. There are more than 1.9m new cases and more than 900,000 deaths a year, according to the World Health Organization.In the trial, funded by Merck Sharp and Dohme and sponsored by University College London, researchers recruited 32 patients with stage two or three bowel cancer and a certain genetic profile (MMR deficient/MSI-High bowel cancer) from five hospitals in the UK.About 15% of patients with stage two or three bowel cancer have this particular genetic makeup.Patients were given nine weeks of pembrolizumab, also known as Keytruda, before surgery instead of the usual treatment of chemotherapy and surgery, then monitored over time.Results show 59% of patients had no signs of cancer after treatment with pembrolizumab, with any cancer in the remaining 41% of patients removed during surgery.All of the patients in the trial were cancer-free after treatment. When standard chemotherapy was given to patients with this genetic profile, fewer than 5% had no signs of cancer after surgery, UCL said.Over the next few years, the trial will also assess overall survival and relapse rates.The approach also meant patients did not require any post-operative chemotherapy, which has side effects and is tough to endure.Dr Kai-Keen Shiu, the trial’s chief investigator and a consultant medical oncologist at UCLH, said: “Our results indicate that pembrolizumab is a safe and highly effective treatment to improve outcomes in patients with high-risk bowel cancers, increasing the chances of curing the disease at an early stage.”Shiu cautioned that the team would need to wait to see whether the patients in the trial remained cancer-free over a longer period of time, but said the initial indications were “extremely positive”.“Immunotherapy can make tumours disappear before surgery. If you melt the cancer away before surgery you normally triple survival chances,” Shiu added. “If patients have a complete response to pembrolizumab it can triple your chance of survival.“Patients also don’t need any chemotherapy after so they avoid all those side effects.”Dr Marnix Jansen, a clinician scientist at the UCL Cancer Institute, said more work needed to be done to assess pembrolizumab before it could be considered standard treatment. “But given the quality of the outcomes in this trial I think it’s possible that we could see it in the clinic within a couple of years if subsequent trials are similarly successful.”"}

High unemployment, power cuts, violent crime and crumbling infrastructure have contributed to a haemorrhaging of support for the former liberation movement.The pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA) won 87 seats, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) - a new party led by President Cyril Ramaphosa’s bitter rival, the former president Jacob Zuma – took 58, and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a Marxist-Leninist party led by the ousted ANC youth leader Julius Malema, took 39.Chart showing vote share by partyThe ANC also lost its majority in three provinces: Northern Cape; Gauteng, which is home to the commercial centre Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria; and KwaZulu-Natal, where MK was the largest party.“What this election has made plain is that the people of South Africa expect their leaders to work together to meet their needs,” Ramaphosa told an audience of politicians, diplomats and civil society leaders after the official results announcement, as thunder rumbled outside.“They expect the parties for which they have voted to find common ground, to overcome their differences, to act and work together for the good of everyone.”Ramaphosa also joked, to laughter from the crowd, that he wished it was true when the electoral commission chairman accidentally said that he was announcing the 2029 election results.The president faces questions about his future, though, as the ANC turns to the task of coalition building. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Zuma’s MK party said they had boycotted the election results event.Zuma had warned before the results announcement that it should not go ahead, saying “people would be provoked”, raising the spectre of the deadly riots that broke out when he was sent to prison in 2021.The position of Ramaphosa was not on the table during the coalition talks that will now take place, the general secretary of the ANC said before the final results were announced.ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula told a press conference at the election results centre: “If you come to us with a demand that Ramaphosa must step down as the president, that is not going to happen … It’s a no-go area. You come to us with that demand, forget it.”MK leaders have said they will not work with the ANC while it is led by Ramaphosa, who Zuma is hell-bent on exacting revenge against. Zuma was president from 2009 to 2018 and was forced to resign by the ANC amid corruption allegations, which he denies.Jacob Zuma said the final results announcement should not go ahead as ‘people would be provoked’. Photograph: Alet Pretorius/Reuters“Political parties have approached us and we will be talking to … everybody,” Mbalula said. “Talks about talks are in full swing.“We’ve got many reservations about that party, but we will talk to them,” he said of the MK. “But no political party will dictate terms like that to us as the ANC.”The ANC is in its weakest position since it swept to power under Nelson Mandela in 1994. Nonetheless, it has options beyond Zuma’s MK.Chart showing ANC’s declining vote share since 2004A tie-up with the DA could be favoured by the more business-friendly wing of the ANC. However, such a coalition would face criticisms from the many black South Africans who see the white-led DA as favouring the interests of white people, which the DA denies. Some analysts have said that bringing in a third, black-led party could help the ANC head off those criticisms.DA leaders have said a coalition is an option, as well as a “confidence and supply” arrangement with an ANC minority government and staying in opposition.Another option for the ANC, and one that is likely to be preferred by the left wing of the party, is to link up with the EFF.A coalition with Julius Malema’s Economic Freedom Fighters is likely to be preferred by the left wing of the ANC. Photograph: Phill Magakoe/AFP/Getty ImagesThat option would need another partner to clear the 50% needed, however. Often mentioned is the Inkatha Freedom party (IFP), which took 17 seats, and, like the MK, gets most of its support from Zulu people.The MK had demanded a recount, making unsubstantiated allegations of vote rigging.“Nobody must declare tomorrow. If that happens, people will be provoked, we know what we are talking about,” Zuma, 82, told reporters at the results centre on Saturday. “Don’t start trouble when there is no trouble.”The words of Zuma, who was the ANC’s intelligence chief during apartheid, had raised fears of violence. More than 300 people were killed in riots in July 2021 riots after Zuma was sent to jail for contempt of court.The constitution stipulates that parliament must sit within 14 days of the final election results and elect a president at that first sitting."}

Save them! Their spirits are lost here! We can’t see them but they are here!” the 85-year-old medicine man, César Marubo, cried out, imploring his people’s God and creator, Kana Voã, to guide their souls towards paradise.“Take them by the hand and lift them up into heaven!” Marubo pleaded, his eyes also filling with tears.Alessandra Sampaio weeps as she visits the site where her husband, Dom Phillips, was ambushed and killed in 2022. Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianOn the riverbank before them, framed by Amazonian money trees laden with bright red fruit, two wooden crosses marked the spot where Phillips and Pereira were ambushed and murdered, allegedly by a trio of illegal fishers who are in prison awaiting trial.“What I most want is to leave this pain behind,” Sampaio had said the previous evening, as she prepared to make her first journey to the place where Phillips’s final reporting mission came to a sudden end.Sampaio’s visit, marking the two-year anniversary of a crime that shocked the world, was part of a deeply personal quest to come to terms with the loss of her husband, a longtime Guardian reporter who was writing a book about the Amazon when he was killed.“I’m not angry. I’ve never felt anger, I just miss him so much,” said Sampaio, who wears the wedding ring recovered from her husband’s body around her neck.But the pilgrimage was also designed to announce the creation of the Dom Phillips Institute, which will honour the journalist’s legacy through educational initiatives raising awareness of the complexities and magnificence of the Amazon and its original inhabitants.“We don’t want to be frozen in pain and frustration. We want to forge ahead,” Sampaio said as she journeyed by boat along the Itaquaí river towards the shrine activists have built at the scene of the crime. “We must transform this pain into a positive movement – and give new meaning to everything that happened.”Sampaio: ‘I’m not angry. I’ve never felt anger … I just miss him so much.’ Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianSampaio said the institute would be guided by the qualities for which her husband was known: tenderness, a burning desire to listen, and respect for diversity and life.“I think that if Dom was here talking to me now he’d say: ‘Go Alê: move forwards, learn more, make contacts, help to echo this message about this incredible thing that is the Amazon and all of its beauties,’” Sampaio said before travelling to the memorial on the same vessel Indigenous searchers used in their dogged 10-day battle to find Phillips and Pereira after they disappeared while heading to the rivertown of Atalaia do Norte.Members of those search teams accompanied Sampaio during last week’s visit to pay tributes of their own.“It was such a tragedy and we are here to celebrate them,” said Binin Carlos Matis, an Indigenous activist who worked with Pereira trying to defend his ancestral home in the Javari valley Indigenous territory, a Portugal-sized sprawl of jungle that is home to the world’s largest concentration of isolated peoples.Orlando Possuelo, an Indigenous expert who helped coordinate the search operation and continues to work in the region, hoped the memorial would also remind frontline activists of the dangers that their struggle to preserve the Amazon involved. “We don’t want the Javari valley to be filled with crosses,” he said.Dom Phillips, left, and Bruno Pereira. Composite: João Laet/AFP/Getty Images (left); Daniel Marenco/Agência O Globo (right)The headquarters of Possuelo’s Indigenous monitoring group, Evu, in Atalaia do Norte was the first stop on Sampaio’s two-day tour of the isolated rainforest region near Brazil’s tri-border with Colombia and Peru.There, she heard distressing reports about the ongoing assault on the Javari valley territory where illegal fishers, poachers, miners and drug traffickers continue to operate despite government pledges to crack down. “There are 300 points of invasion,” Possuelo told Sampaio, pointing to a map peppered with coloured dots denoting the different threats.Alessandra Sampaio meets members of the Marubo and Matis peoples in the Amazon rivertown of Atalaia do Norte. Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianDays earlier Evu activists had chased off a gang of five poachers who had invaded the protected Indigenous territory, confiscating tapir and peccary meat and hundreds of tracajá river turtles they were trying to smuggle out and sell. On the eve of Sampaio’s arrival, an Evu member was assaulted at a local bar – an attack members suspect was motivated by their work.But Sampaio also heard heartening accounts of how Evu had ramped up its activities in the two years since her husband was killed while reporting on the group’s fight to protect Indigenous lives. Evu’s membership has doubled to about 40 since Phillips and Pereira were murdered, with plans for a 116-strong force in the coming years patrolling each of the Javari valley’s six main waterways.The Marubo community, which has voiced concerns about the region’s future. Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianThe next day Sampaio visited the base of the Indigenous association Univaja, which served as the nerve centre of the 2022 search effort, to discuss her plans for the institute and ask local leaders how it could help their cause. “They will not silence Dom’s voice,” she told them.Representatives of the Matis, Marubo and Mayoruna peoples took turns to voice their hopes and fears over the region’s future.Teacher Nilo Marubo spoke gloomily about how a lack of education and opportunities was driving an exodus of young people from Indigenous villages. “When they arrive in the cities they end up getting mixed up in alcoholism, drugs and even [criminal] factions,” he said.Marina Mayuruna, a 27-year-old activist, denounced the violence affecting Indigenous women and girls. “Some men will tell you this doesn’t happen. But it does – and it’s the women who suffer,” she told Sampaio.Marina Mayuruna, an Indigenous leader from the Javari valley region, says women and girls are at risk of violence. Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianClóvis Marubo, a 58-year-old leader, feared younger generations were becoming disconnected from traditional ways of life as western culture marched deeper into the region.“There’s been such a big change in the past 40 years. We are losing our culture. Our culture is becoming folklore,” he said, ruing how many youngsters no longer knew how to hunt monkeys or peccary, use bows and arrows, or speak their native tongues.Silvana Marubo lamented the unabating threats to Indigenous activists and their non-Indigenous allies. “I worry who the next Doms and Brunos will be,” she said, telling Sampaio: “Your pain is our pain … your tears are our tears. Your struggle is our struggle.”Sampaio listened intently as her Indigenous hosts spoke, engrossed by their oration just as her journalist husband had been. At times tears rolled down her cheeks. At others she smiled and laughed, radiating hope and admiration as she heard their petitions.Outside, Phillips’s 53-year-old widow caught constant glimpses of the Amazonian treasures and peculiarities that had so captivated her partner. The boisterous yellow-rumped cacique birds feasting on mangoes in trees lining the rivertown’s streets. Dolphins cavorting in the waters below. The phantasmagoric statues of snakes, jaguars and saints adorning Atalaia do Norte’s squares.One afternoon Sampaio took part in a Matis whipping ritual called mariwin, where men wearing ceramic masks and covered in fern leaves thrash participants with palm stalks to frighten off evil spirits. Sampaio winced as the lash struck her back but vowed to return to the Javari valley to ensure the Dom Phillips institute’s first project benefited a place he had loved and where he was lost.During her two-day visit Sampaio took part in a Matis whipping ritual called mariwin.

The state attorney general confirmed another death at a polling center in Tlapanala, also in Puebla.Mexico’s largest-ever elections have also been the most violent in modern history, with the murders of 38 candidates, including a local candidate who was fatally shot on Saturday night. The deadly violence has stoked concerns about the threat of warring drug cartels to democracy.Sheinbaum, who has led in opinion polls over her main competitor Xochitl Galvez, will be tasked with confronting organized crime violence, if elected. More people were killed during the mandate of outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador than during any other administration in Mexico’s modern history.A victory by either woman would represent a major step for Mexico, a country known for its macho culture. The winner will begin a six-year term on 1 October.On her way to vote on Sunday morning, Sheinbaum told journalists it was a “historic day” and that she felt at ease and content.“Everyone must get out to vote,” Sheinbaum, a physicist and former Mexico City mayor, said on local TV.Galvez, a senator who represents an opposition coalition comprised of the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), the right-wing Pan and the leftist PRD party, chatted with supporters before casting her ballot early Sunday.“God is with me,” Galvez said, adding that she was expecting a difficult day.Lopez Obrador, Sheinbaum’s mentor, greeted supporters and posed for photos as he walked from the presidential palace to vote with his wife.Long lines of people waiting to vote stretched outside polling places in Guadalajara, Jalisco state, Mexico on 2 June. Mexicans voted Sunday in a presidential election dominated by two women. Photograph: Ulises Ruiz/AFP/Getty ImagesThere were long lines of voters outside polling places, even before they opened at 8am local time, with some reports of delayed openings.“It seems like a dream to me. I never imagined that one day I would vote for a woman,” said 87-year-old Edelmira Montiel, a Sheinbaum supporter in Tlaxcala, Mexico’s smallest state.“Before we couldn’t even vote, and when you could, it was to vote for the person your husband told you to vote for. Thank God that has changed and I get to live it,” Montiel added.Almost 100m Mexicans are eligible to vote in Sunday’s election. Other positions up for grabs include Mexico City’s mayor, eight governorships and both chambers of Congress. About 20,000 elected positions are on ballots, the most in Mexico’s history.The polls will close at 6pm local time. The first official preliminary results are expected late on Sunday.Both candidates have promised to expand welfare programs, though Mexico has a large deficit this year and sluggish GDP growth of just 1.5% expected by the central bank next year.The new president will face tense negotiations with the United States over the huge flows of US-bound migrants crossing Mexico and security cooperation over drug trafficking at a time when the US fentanyl epidemic rages.Mexican officials expect these negotiations to be more difficult if the US presidency is won by Donald Trump in November. Trump, the first US president to be convicted of a crime, has vowed to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese cars made in Mexico and said he would mobilize special forces to fight the cartels.Sam Castillo, a 25-year-old dancer who lives between Oaxaca state and Mexico City, said he hoped Sheinbaum could be stronger on foreign relations than Lopez Obrador had been.As he waited to vote at a polling place in the Florida district in the south of Mexico City, he said he felt better with the leftist Morena in power as part of the LGBTQ+ community.“What we have seen with gender legislation, with marriage equality, for me it has to do with party,” Castillo said."}

She stopped short of setting a target, however, saying the Conservatives had failed when they had done so.Meanwhile, Keir Starmer made a renewed pitch for Conservative voters with a manifesto commitment to slash levels of immigration and ban law-breaking employers from hiring foreign workers.Plans outlined by the Labour leader in the Sun on Sunday could include laws to bar companies that break employment law – by failing to pay the minimum wage, for example – from hiring workers from overseas. New legislation would also link the immigration system to training, with businesses that apply for foreign worker visas having to train British people to do the jobs.Cooper told the BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “We’re not setting a target and the reason for that is partly because, to be honest, every time the Conservatives have done this, frankly, then they have just ended up being totally all over the place, ripping it up and discredited the whole system.“Also, because from one year to another, there are variations. So, for example, the pandemic means the net migration figures, of course, fell, but the homes for Ukraine visa rightly meant that the figures increased because of the war in Ukraine.”When pressed by Trevor Phillips on Sky News as to whether she believed UK residents could fill the thousands of vacancies in the adult social care sector and replace foreign workers, Cooper said there would continue to be a health and social care visa.“Immigration has always been important to this country, including for international talent and different areas, but it needs to be properly controlled,” she said.James Cleverly, the home secretary, responded to Labour’s plans by taking aim at its leader. “Keir Starmer has a track record of supporting high immigration levels and helping foreign criminals stay in Britain because he believes all immigration law is racist,” he said.“This is yet another day where Starmer will say what he thinks people want to hear during an election because he lacks conviction to say what he believes.”The Scottish National party, which held a campaign rally with more than 200 activists and candidates in Glasgow on Sunday afternoon, was critical of Labour’s pledge to cut net migration.The SNP leader, John Swinney, said Scottish businesses were struggling to fill vacancies, adding: “The biggest economic threat to Scotland is the current hostility towards migration that we have from the UK.”To applause, Swinney said Starmer’s rhetoric was “playing to a particular audience” that did not exist in Scotland”.The UK has experienced broadly similar levels of immigration as other high-income countries over the past few decades, according to the University of Oxford’s Migration Observatory. Net migration – a commonly used measure of the overall scale of migration – was “unusually high” in the 12 months up to the end of June 2023, the thinktank said in January.On illegal immigration, Cooper said Labour’s “initial assessments” suggested it would take a year to stop spending money on hotels to accommodate asylum seekers.While Labour has pledged to scrap the government’s Rwanda scheme, Cooper declined to rule out sending asylum seekers to another country to have their claims processed.“Keir has always said we would look at what works and there are different kinds of … offshore processing arrangements and things that have already been used at different times in the past,” she told the BBC."}

It followed days of speculation that Abbot would be blocked from standing, culminating in her accusing Labour of carrying out a “cull of leftwingers”.On Sunday evening Abbott also denied a report that she had been offered a seat in the House of Lords if she agreed to stand aside in the constituency she has represented for 37 years.“I have never been offered a seat in the Lords, and would not accept one if offered. I am the adopted Labour candidate for Hackney North & Stoke Newington. I intend to run and to win as Labour’s candidate,” she posted on X.The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, had earlier denied reports in the Sunday Times that a string of Labour MPs had been offered peerages to quit and make way for allies of Starmer.She told Sky News on Sunday: “It’s not the way the system works. There’s a whole process with the independent committee that will vet nominations. There have to be processes in terms of the numbers of nominations designated by the prime minister and so on.”Cooper said that “no party can do that or make that sort of commitment”, but in practice party leaders and the prime minister do have that power. While nominations are vetted by an independent committee, it is for political parties to decide who receives them. The committee checks if the nominee is a person of good standing but does not have a veto.Abbott was widely expected by Labour MPs to announce her retirement and be given a peerage, until a Labour source briefed last week that she would be banned from standing, after which Abbott said she still intended to fight to be a candidate.She was suspended from the party last year after writing a letter to the Observer saying that Jewish people and Travellers suffered prejudice but not racism, comparing their experiences with those of people with red hair.Abbott apologised for her remarks but was placed under investigation and lost the Labour whip.At one stage, the possibility of her standing as an independent had been a real one. She told a rally of supporters last week that she intended to stand in the general election “by any means possible”.Labour’s ruling national executive committee (NEC) will hold a crucial meeting on Tuesday to decide whether or not to endorse a range of candidates for a number of remaining seats.The party has already announced a flurry of candidates in safe seats who are close allies of Starmer and have been instrumental in overhauling the party since Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Election EditionMake sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

Labour believes the prime minister’s account of his past will be a fundamental test, given he has built his reputation on his economic competence.The battle lines on policy have already been drawn for the debate on Tuesday with both sides building their defences as well as preparing their attacks. The Conservatives will want to focus on gender, defence spending and pensions – all areas where Labour has been challenged to match their commitments and has not done so. Labour has been doing groundwork on other key weak spots over the weekend – on bringing down net migration and on commitment to the UK’s nuclear deterrent.But both sides are now prepared for things to start getting personal. Sunak is doing his debate preparations with Oliver Dowden. The deputy prime minister has been asked to play Starmer and Tory aides will be in a mock audience asking hostile questions. Sunak believes the debates are key to changing the narrative and that the audience will be watching him for signs of the underdog making a comeback.Labour knows the debate is its to lose and wants to keep the number of these to a minimum, brushing aside Tory challenges to hold up to six head-to-head debates. In its debate prep, Tom Webb, Labour’s policy director, stands in for Sunak, continuing the role he has played during PMQs prep. Starmer will appear at one public event on Monday but will then turn his full focus to preparations.Over the last few months, Starmer’s team have deliberately picked events which involve Q&As with groups of workers, with one eye on getting him debate-ready. “We know that people are quite cautious about asking difficult questions in front of their bosses, but there have been a few, and it’s good practice,” said one Labour source. “But we definitely haven’t drafted in any Labour councillors.”Another added: “The debate will be a big moment. It’s the first time that many voters will have seen Keir and Sunak go head to head as they will only just have started paying attention to politics since the election was called. But we’re feeling confident. Keir is good at this stuff, and he’s well prepared.”Internally, Labour also has a crucial week. On Tuesday the national executive committee will meet to finally approve all candidates for elections, the crunch point for any final complaints or resignations, but it is now seen as broadly a formality.While Starmer is focused on debate preparations until Tuesday, the leader’s attention after that will be on the manifesto. On Friday, Labour will convene its pivotal “clause V” meeting, where its most influential figures will go through the manifesto line by line and thrash out any outstanding differences.Those present will include the shadow cabinet, MPs on the parliamentary Labour party committee, the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, the Welsh first minister, Vaughan Gething, and 11 trade union general secretaries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Election EditionMake sense of the UK election campaign with Archie Bland's daily briefing, direct to your inbox at 5pm (BST).

On Sunday, she confirmed she would stand as Labour’s candidate.Key to Labour’s attempt to get back on the front foot will be to scrutinise Sunak’s time as a partner at TCI, the hedge fund which launched an activist campaign against Dutch bank ABN Amro which resulted in its sale to RBS in 2007. The takeover was later described as “an extremely risky deal” by the independent financial regulator which said it was a key factor leading to RBS’s failure.Starmer also on Sunday promised to cut net migration by training unemployed Britons to do jobs normally taken by overseas workers. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, told broadcasters that it was clear net migration must come down, though stopped short of setting a target.Starmer and Sunak will go head-to-head on ITV at the first election debate this Tuesday.Starmer hopes to force an interrogation of Sunak on his past at TCI, after their involvement in the deal that saw a bank riddled with sub-prime mortgages sold to RBS. Separately, Sunak’s boss at the multi-billion fund, Chris Hohn, admitted to a select committee in January 2009 that the fund had bet against British banks during the crash.Sunak was a partner in TCI when it began pushing the sale of ABN Amro via its 1% stake in the Dutch bank in early 2007 and lobbied heavily for RBS’s takeover bid. The RBS-led consortium bought ABN Amro for £50bn in October 2007 – the biggest takeover in banking history.The taxpayer spent £45.5bn bailing out RBS and the independent regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), said “it is clear that the acquisition undoubtedly contributed significantly to RBS’s vulnerability”.Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, told the Guardian he believed Sunak had “bet against Britain” during his time before politics. “If I was still a member of the liaison committee, I would definitely have been asking questions about his past behaviour, because I think it’s in the public interest that voters know that he essentially bet against Britain and may have profited off the back of it,” he said.“This is exactly the type of past behaviour where if you become a public official or you come into public office, you need to be accountable and transparent about that.”There is no suggestion that Sunak or TCI broke any rules during the sale of ABN Amro. But Jones said it was a matter of the integrity of the man who became chancellor and then prime minister.“I think that there is a public interest in him fessing up about his role during this period of time and people understanding the fact that when they were having to suffer the consequences of austerity that followed under the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in coalition years, that Rishi Sunak was at the heart of this,” he said.Jones said records show Sunak was one of a very small team. TCI had 19 partners during the two years the deal took place.He said that Sunak would have been aware of the deal. “This was the biggest banking deal at the time.” The Treasury has previously said Sunak did not have a direct role in the deal.A Conservative spokesperson said in response to the attack: “This is not correct. The Labour party created the banking crisis which caused Labour’s great recession. In 2008, while Starmer chose to be in a foreign court defending terrorists, Rachel Reeves was part of the mortgage team at HBOS that had to be bailed out by the taxpayer at a cost of tens of billions and turfed thousands of families from their homes.”The BBC announced on Sunday night that the second of the leaders’ debates had been scheduled for 26 June – the last week of the campaign. Labour is unlikely to agree to any further debates for the party leader.Labour will also hope to see the end of rows over candidate selections which dominated the news agenda last week, though the ousted Chingford and Woodford Green candidate Faiza Shaheen is still considering legal action.On Tuesday morning, Labour’s national executive committee will rubber stamp all of the candidates, which include a string of key allies of Starmer. Last week, Starmer was forced to U-turn on a reported plan to engineer the retirement of Abbott and said last week she was free to stand in Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Her close friend Shami Chakrabarti raised the possibility Abbott could still retire, saying she was being encouraged to think about her political future. Abbott confirmed on Sunday afternoon she would stand again as an MP, with the party’s backing."}

The family was left homeless, living out of a tent for almost a month. They are now surviving off charity.“We came to Australia in 2009 with my wife and until February 2024 I have had full-time work rights with no issue,” Singh said. “All that time – 14 years.”Singh said his visa was set to expire and he was required to submit an application to renew it, which he did before the due date. “On time – no issues,” he said.But he said the immigration department did not process his application until two days later – after the due date. “So I was illegal for that period,” Singh said.“We gave them the evidence. They agreed but said it was the system [and] they could not do much about it. So now I am on a bridging visa with no work rights.”After he was denied working rights in February, Singh lost his job as a truck driver for a company in Mildura. As he was the sole bread winner for his family, they were evicted. They were forced to live in a tent.Singh sold their belongings – a phone, a laptop and a car – and along with some money from the local Sikh community the family was able to pay for three months’ rent on a property in Caroline Springs in Melbourne’s west. He does not know what they will do in six weeks when the rent runs out.‘With the kids, it’s hard to give them an answer every day,’ Singh says. Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The GuardianSingh said he was paying off a fine he received for an issue with his truck logbook, as well as a buy now, pay later loan. The family was unable to pay some of their bills and now has debt collectors pursuing payment, but Singh cannot tell them when he will have work.“It’s getting hard,” he said. “It’s no problem with the food. Food we are getting from Sikh community, but [we can’t afford] other stuff.“With the kids, it’s hard to give them an answer every day – it’d be hard to explain to them.”Carina Ford, an immigration lawyer, is representing Singh and said the case was now before the minister, which is the family’s last resort.Ford said Singh lost his working rights because he was deemed to have had a “period of unlawfulness”.“Not due to their fault – due to the department not processing the bridging visa on time,” she said. “As a result, they’ve been put on a bridging visa with no work rights.“That’s because the legislation says you must not have a period of unlawfulness, even if it’s not your fault.”Ford said the family had requested compensation, but it would not cover what was needed to continue paying rent and the family could be waiting months to hear back about their case.“They can grant them a bridging visa under another ground, which would enable work rights, which is what they used to do in the past,” Ford said.Ford said there were “systemic issues” with how long it took to grant bridging visas.“We spend a lot of our time chasing up the department granting bridging visas, because they just can’t keep up with the processing.“This is a pretty unfair result. The system is such that if you get strict interpretation, you’re left with issues like this.”The Department of Home Affairs has not responded to Guardian Australia’s request for comment.Singh said he had only $25 in his bank account and he was not sure what the family would do. They are worried they may have to leave Australia to go back to India, even though two of their children were born in Australia and became citizens after their 10th birthdays.“We’re worried about leaving Australia because we have been living here 14 years. We have nothing back there,” he said. “Please, I just need my work rights back.”"}

In an interview with the Guardian in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said he had “no strategy yet” for what to do if Trump returned to the White House, and that the former British prime minister Boris Johnson had approached him on his behalf.\n Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged world leaders to come to a peace conference in Switzerland this month, and accused China of discouraging attendance at the meeting. “We are disappointed that some world leaders have not yet confirmed their participation in the peace summit,” Zelenskiy told delegates on the last day of the Shangri-La Dialogue forum in Singapore during an unscheduled appearance. US President Joe Biden has as yet given no indication he will attend the summit. Zelenskiy added: “Regrettably, Russia, using Chinese influence on the region, using Chinese diplomats also, does everything to disrupt the peace summit. It is unfortunate that such a big, independent, powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin.”\n Zelenskiy meanwhile said he had a “very good” meeting with US defence secretary Lloyd Austin in Singapore. The meeting came after Washington decided to partially lift restrictions on using US-provided weapons to strike inside Russia, which Zelensky has hailed as a “step forward”.

He said he had no issue with Forrest personally, but objected to the “swindle-factory so-called windfarms all over our area”.“I thought I’ll make a statement so people will say, ‘why are you doing that?’” he said.Well, mission accomplished. But I remain confused. Because in the place of the RMs at question time earlier this month was a pair of Ariat cowboy boots. Specifically, my image searching revealed, the Cowpuncher VentTEK in the dark brown/golden mustard colourway.Andrew Forrest urges shift to renewables and attacks 'bulldust of nuclear policies'  – videoAccording to the product description, the boots are designed to provide “a soft landing when you jump off the feed truck or off your horse”, while the vents in the scrolling “keeps you cool in the heat or in branding season”.This is fine. I’ve got nothing against a good pair of Ariats, though as a horse rider in the English disciplines my Ariats are a pair of half chaps. (That also precisely ages me, for anyone who follows equestrian fashion trends.)They’re also more comfortable than RM Williams – Joyce said as much in that interview. They’re a work boot, and he is at work, and as a person who wears farm boots literally everywhere I cannot begrudge him on an aesthetic level.But what perplexes me is why he chose Ariats. Ariat is a quintessentially American brand – it’s named for the racehorse Secretariat. This would be like an American politician trying to appeal to their patriotic base by wearing boots called Phar Lap. The main argument for Australian politicians wearing RM Williams is that they are an iconic Australian brand – although before Forrest bought it the brand was owned by LVMH, more commonly known as Louis Vuitton.The Australiana is, in the theatre of parliament, the whole point. We don’t give visiting dignitaries an Akubra and a Driza-Bone because they’re appropriate bureaucratic attire. If this can be cancelled out by a mining magnate following the economic winds and investing in renewable energy, a decision that whatever other motives you might ascribe is clearly that of a billionaire making a business decision, then we may as well have been wearing lace-ups this whole time.Ariat is also not necessarily a choice that signals disdain for renewable energy: the Fisher family, founders of the Gap, bought the equestrian apparel company in 2012. The Gap has an emissions reduction goal of 90% by 2030 and its chairman, Robert Fisher, is an environmentalist who sat for 20 years on the board of the National Resources Defense Council, an organisation which supports, among other things, federal tax incentives to boost the renewable economy and responsible construction of offshore windfarms.Barnaby Joyce seen in his Ariat boots: ‘Not necessarily a choice that signals disdain for renewable energy.’ Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPIt is particularly perplexing because another boot option is right there: Gina Rinehart, who very loudly does not support renewable energy, bought Rossi Boots through her company S Kidman & Co in December. As the Australian Financial Review pointed out, this set the stage for the “battle of the billionaire boots”. You can now signal your allegiance simply by the stitching on your boot tug.Blundstone, which is still Australian-owned although they are no longer manufactured in Tasmania, is another option. Or Baxters, also Australian-owned and manufactured overseas.As an extremely dorky horse girl who was – and remains – incapable of tying shoelaces so they won’t become unravelled within 20 minutes, I have owned all of these boots.I have RMs for the office, Blundstones for walking through mud on the farm, and Dublin short boots (or Jodhpur or paddock boots or whatever you want to call them except for Chelsea boot) for riding. The key consideration, with the exception of the RMs, which my mum gave me for my 30th birthday when she realised I was turning up to the office in a pair of extremely beat-up 15-year-old Baxters, is cost of replacement. I wear my boots until my socks soak through and the average lifespan is about two years.Joyce’s Ariat roper boots ($450) or the standard shoe of Australian politics or consulting, the RM Craftsman ($649), are too expensive for such use. The latter are sale day boots, fancy boots – that’s the reason the National party started wearing them in the first place. You would never wear your work boots to a livestock sale or a dinner or a political meeting. The well-kept chestnut leather of a pair of RMs that spends the rest of the month sitting buffed clean in the wardrobe is a sign of respect.Despite the price tag, roper boots don’t really have that cachet. It’s one thing to pretend to be a working farmer, it’s another to cosplay as Clinton Anderson.But perhaps that’s the point. The Australian right is increasingly importing tactics from rightwing groups in the US, it may as well copy the footwear. As Joyce took to the stage at an anti-renewables rally in Canberra earlier this year, a man shouted into the microphone: “We need someone like Donald Trump to save us.”He may be a shoo-in."}

Crossing health districts, like crossing state borders, is only done in critical cases, for “time-urgent” patients. Other injured and ill patients are referred to the closest tertiary hospital in their health district in an emergency – even if it means travelling further.In 2022, an inquiry by the NSW parliament into the delivery of rural health services “repeatedly” heard of people being let down by the health system. In its report, released in May 2022, the inquiry chair, Labor MP Greg Donnelly, said the committee “heard stories of emergency departments with no doctors; of patients being looked after by cooks and cleaners; of excessive wait times for treatment; and of misdiagnoses and medical errors”. It highlighted the particular difficulties for border communities, singling out Tenterfield, just 50km up the road from Deepwater and a whisker away from the Queensland border.A second parliamentary inquiry looking into the response to the first inquiry began this week.Lindy Newsome tending to her horses. Photograph: Simon Scott/The GuardianLismore MP Janelle Saffin was elected in 2019, one year before Queensland closed its borders to NSW residents, cutting many of her constituents off from their closest hospital.“Tenterfield is in my area, and people regularly say they want to go over the border to Queensland but they get shunted to Glen Innes or Armidale and could end up at John Hunter in Newcastle, a long way away,” she says. “There are hospitals in Queensland that can accommodate all their medical needs.”The recently opened Tweed Valley hospital will “take the pressure off”, she says, but it’s not enough; she’s calling for all 44 recommendations of the 2022 inquiry to be fully implemented. “You don’t change big bureaucracies overnight,” she says. “There have been some changes, we just need to see [the recommendations] implemented.”In Tenterfield, cleaner and NDIS support provider Tanya Langdon says residents who need healthcare but cannot drive have the option of a bus to Lismore, which runs three days a week, or the once daily bus to Tamworth or Armidale.“The hardest and most exhausting task of tending to and maintaining health in our town is the travel that’s all too often required,” she says.“Services like telehealth and traveling specialists and mobile clinics are helping … however sometimes you must travel to hospitals for treatments, operations, equipment, it’s unavoidable.”Langdon says the burden of care is being placed on to patients and their loved ones, left to organise appointments across state and district lines, and battle growing waitlists in regional doctor’s clinics.Rural chair of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, associate professor Michael Clements, says GPs are “caught in the middle” of complex cross-border health arrangements.Lindy Newsome walking around one of the paddocks on the property she owns with husband Bruce. Photograph: Simon Scott Photo“What we need to see is that the state and federal fund holders – those that hold the money and make the decisions – are actually in the same room with the GPs, with community members and community representatives, the mayors and the councillors, and actually finding out what needs to happen,” he says.It’s a similar situation on the Victoria-NSW border. The federal member for Indi, Helen Haines, says state and federal governments are looking for a “cheap deal” at the cost of patient health.“People write in to me and tell me that, with a population our size, they’re shocked that they can’t have cardiac intervention surgery,” she says. “We have a cardiac catheter laboratory, it can’t be opened every day of the week because we don’t have the staff to do so … they have to fly or drive to Melbourne or Sydney.”Haines says there needs to be a “serious investment” in regional healthcare to bridge the rural-urban divide in health outcomes.A redevelopment of the biggest hospital in that region, the $558m Albury base hospital project, which is jointly funded by the NSW and Victorian governments, has been criticised by healthcare workers who say it will “barely cover the significant gap in beds and theatres that we have now”.The Victorian government said a $13bn investment in public health, announced in last month’s state budget, would help residents on both sides of the border access the healthcare they need.“We’re making sure everyone that lives on the border – no matter which side – can get the care they need, no matter where they live,” they said.A spokesperson for NSW Health says the processes behind cross-border patient transfers are “specific” and “robust,” based on the clinical situation at hand and the need of a patient and their family.“Patients are always referred to the most appropriate health facility based on multiple considerations including the level of care required, the location of the patient and demand for services,” he said."}

The government last week confirmed a new direction would be issued.“What we’re doing now is making it absolutely crystal-clear for the AAT and departmental officials interpreting it that community safety is to be the number one priority, more than anything else,” Watt said.Under direction 99 the strength, nature and duration of ties to Australia are considered alongside four other “primary considerations”: protecting the community, “whether the conduct engaged in constituted family violence”, the interests of children and expectations of the Australian community.Albanese announces reversal of ministerial ruling that saw criminals given visas – videoWatt said the AAT had interpreted direction 99 in a way the government hadn’t intended, with a person’s ties to Australia being considered too highly. He said the government didn’t mean “for community safety to be relegated below that as a priority”.“What would have been a mistake is if the government had said that we want to put duration of stay above community safety and we didn’t do that,” he said.The new direction is yet to be shared publicly. Government sources said it was likely to be finalised in coming days. It will be issued by the minister, and not require legislative change.Watt also hit back at criticisms from the Coalition, claiming visa cancellation rates were lower since Labor had come to office, and that Labor had “deported more criminals in our first year in office than the government ever did under Peter Dutton’s reign”.Watt confirmed again the government was using drones to monitor immigration detainees released under the NZYQ high court verdict. There had been confusion last week after immigration minister Andrew Giles said drones were being used in the government’s response “to keep track of people”. SBS reported on Friday that many police services and security agencies had either said they weren’t operating the drones, or declined to comment.Watt said the drones were being used “in an operational sense”.“My understanding is that drones are being used as part of this operation, but more in the sense of monitoring the accommodation people are living in, for example, ensuring that it’s not too close to schools or other areas that they’re not supposed to be living close to,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This imagery can also assist identify facilities in proximity of the accommodation that may be relevant to an individual’s visa conditions,” the spokesperson said.Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, shadow home affairs minister James Paterson questioned the use of drones.“You don’t need a drone to do that. That sounds like satellite imagery. It sounds like, frankly, something a 12-year-old would get on Google Earth.“Either Andrew Giles accidentally and casually disclosed a previously secret drone surveillance program operating domestically in Australia … Or he made it up and it’s not actually happening at all,” he said.An Australian Border Force spokesperson last week said it does not comment on “the specifics of its operational capability or that of its law enforcement partners” but that federal authorities were “working closely with state and territory authorities and law enforcement to ensure community safety”.“The use of surveillance technology by law enforcement agencies is governed by strict legislative requirements,” the ABF said."}

It’s covered in the rich orange of Hermès, one of the world’s most expensive luxury brands, and sits on the counter, elaborately embossed logo on the outside. Inside is a handbag made of alligator skin and tanned green. It’s secondhand but comes with a $85,000 price tag. You could fit a phone in it and not much more.Casually he moves a $20,000 vintage Chanel handbag out of the way, to the other side of his desk. It almost seems a steal sitting in such proximity to the smaller, rarer Hermès that would cost the price of a deposit for an apartment.“At the moment, the trend is the smaller, the more expensive,” Leung says.His store is for the wealthy elite who don’t want to be on the wait list for a Birkin or who are unhappy with the one offered and want it in a different colour.It’s also for the “want-to-be aspirational middle class” looking to get a bargain – a high-end brand at a consignment price. The store, The Purse Affair, is filled wall to wall with secondhand designer bags – more choice than you would ever get shopping inside Gucci or Fendi or Dior.The Purse Affair resells pre-loved, pre-hated or pre-ambivalent luxury handbags. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianLeung and his wife have built a small empire – becoming national leaders in reselling pre-loved, pre-hated or pre-ambivalent luxury handbags.“We’re that gap in the market, we can get the exact bag, get clients what they want … immediately,” he says.And increasing numbers of clients want their goods.There are a number of Australians – 10% of the population in fact – who have been sheltered from the winds of high inflation, the cost-of-living crisis, the housing crisis, the low jobseeker crisis, the everything going up except wages crisis. Last week the Productivity Commission released a report into inequality in Australia, and it showed that during the pandemic their disposable income shot up.And the divide is stark. In April renters increased their spending by 1.3%, while the nation’s homeowners with no mortgage splashed the cash at 6.3%, a report from Commonwealth Bank recently revealed.“You can see some pretty significant differences there,” CBA chief economist, Stephen Halmarick, says.“We can see that the weakest spending is people in the age bracket 25 to 29, who you would imagine are probably first-time renters.“You have to go all the way up to people aged 60 and above to see spending rising by more than the rate of inflation.”Those insulated from economic turmoil, those who have the cash, are splashing it.Some are spending money on gyms. Last May, property developer Tim Gurner, who is worth $989m according to the AFR, and rose to public prominence with his infamous comments that millennials should stop buying avocado toast, launched a wellness club in Collingwood. Membership at Saint Haven starts at $130 a week and hits $1,000 for full access of the gym, day spa and restaurant. There is now a 15,000-strong waitlist for those who missed out and the club is launching two new venues in ritzy Melbourne suburbs Toorak and South Yarra.“[In Toorak] We wanted to create the Qantas Chairmans Club equivalent of health and wellness, where members are treated to the utmost impeccable level of personalised service that you can’t get anywhere else,” a spokesperson for Saint Haven said.The art market is also buoyant – with total sales at auction houses hitting $140m by the time the last gavel came down in 2023. Partner and managing director of Michael Reid Galleries, Toby Meagher, says while Covid-lockdown customers have dropped off, the premier price range is booming.Their next show, with contemporary Indigenous painter Regina Pilawuk Wilson, opens in a week and has already sold out. The works range from $15,000 to $40,000.“There’s obviously a real depth of collectors happy to spend at those levels,” Reid says.“We’re not seeing a slowdown at all in that premier price range.”In boutiques, at the high-end stores on Melbourne’s Collins St and Sydney’s Castlereagh St, the story is similar.Last year more than $1bn was spent on luxury fashion.In 2023 the Australian arm of Hermès, which operates just six stores across the country, made $477.13m – a bump of 23%. That’s a $90m jump in a single year.Chanel recorded sales of $598.5m, up 4.8%.A Bain & Co report revealed luxury sales were up 6% in Australia for the year, following a global trend of 8% – or $2.5tn.‘$8,000 to $16,000 in a few years’As the profits of fashion houses go up so do the prices of their bags.“Chanel and Hermès, all luxury houses, they increase prices two, sometimes three times a year,“ Leung says. “And we’re not talking small amounts but 20% or 30% at a time.”He says one of Chanel’s small classic flaps has gone up from $8,000 to $16,000 in a a few years.

Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianA former staff member at Chanel in Sydney, who spoke to Guardian Australia under the condition of anonymity, says their clients spend hundreds and thousands each year and often come in every two to three weeks. “Top spenders might get to see collections early and reserve pieces, but this is for a very small number of clients.”‘Playing the game’Social media is fuelling the luxury handbag market.No one needs to be told the bags themselves – the material and labour – do not cost their price tag. In the world of TikToker Tanner Leatherstein, whose real name is Volkan Yilmaz, these bags are sliced and diced in seconds to reveal their true quality.One video starts with Yilmaz slashing a Louis Vuitton Go-14 Pico, worth $6,700; in another he dissects a Capucines MM – a casual $11,300. Prada is on the chopping block, so is Yves Saint Laurent. He then tells his 950,000 followers how much the bag likely costs to make.“The price multipliers I see in the luxury brand space vary between 10x to 20x so far,” he says. “If a bag costs $250 in leather, hardware and assembly and labour, it is sold between $2,500 and $5,000.”As the profits of fashion houses go up, so do the prices of their bags. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianThe bags with the deepest lore sell for the most. Grace Kelly was first photographed with her namesake bag to hide her pregnancy. To get a Birkin, prospective buyers have to spend an unknown amount at a Hermès store and build a relationship with a Hermès sales assistant – only then they might be put on the list – where they’ll wait sometimes years.Stories fly around of people who have got them, or tried to. One woman’s husband spent an unknown amount only to bring it home for her and she didn’t like it; another husband bought so many things in a bid to reach the unknown amount that he bought something for a dog he didn’t own; another woman went to Paris, won the lottery for a “leather appointment” – an instore meeting with an assistant – and was only offered a size 28 when she had her heart set on a 25.Online there are endless articles and videos offering tips to high flyers on how to get the bag. This level of exclusivity is what drives the sales, Leung says.Some of their customers come in just to avoid this.“There’s people that don’t want to play the game,” Leung says. “They don’t want to wait for the queue. And they’ll just come to a place like ours and just get the Birkin straight up.‘Honestly, they’ve got the money’The Purse Affair sits at the flat end of Collins Street but still exudes high society. The staff offer water when you arrive, the chandeliers cast soft white light across the shelves and flowers are placed next to Louis Vuitton trunks in the entryway.Leung says a lot of high-end buyers use consignment stores to sell bags they bought two or three years ago – because the prices increase so quickly they can often break even or get most of the money back.Shop owner Alex Leung with the Birkin. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianCollecting is different – many clients will upscale, selling their Gucci or Louis Vuitton to get a Chanel or their Chanel to get a Hermès. Leung says they know what their customers want, and they will often source the bags from overseas for them.“Let’s go back to scarcity. Even if you are very rich, often it’s very hard to get the exact thing that you want.“It’s easier just to go to the resale world or the personal shopper world, and companies like mine, so that you can straight away just get what you want.”Leung says during Covid, like many high-end consignment stores, they recorded more customers. Instead of travelling, people with disposable incomes bought handbags. That wave has ebbed but the market catering to the top end of town is still thriving.“It is resilient,” he says. “We can still hit up clients with a $50,000 offer and they’ll be able to make a decision in a split second. Because honestly, they’ve got the money.”"}

All alone and get very numb,” Lomas wrote.Then, out of the dark, the book suddenly transitions into full colour. Beside a ship sailing into a bay are the words: “Never give up. Things can change.”It’s been seven years since Lomas took her own life and since then the rate of child suicide has steadily increased in Queensland.In the past five years, 128 children have died by suicide, with the rate increasing by 1.9% each year over that period, according to an annual report by the Queensland Family and Child Commission.Suicide is the leading cause of death for those aged 10–17 years, with 20 children dying of suicide in 2022-3, the report says. This is largely due to the number of traffic deaths, which was previously the primary cause of death, reducing for children, according to Prof Kairi Kolves, from the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention at Griffith University.But Prof Jo Robinson, who leads the youth suicide prevention team at Orygen, says the rates of child suicide increased from 2009 to 2020 on a national scale. Reliable data for subsequent years is not yet available.“Queensland is not alone in this problem,” she says. “We’re seeing rising mental health crisis across the country and it really just needs to be addressed by federal and state governments.”‘Services are at capacity or over capacity’Robinson says the drivers of youth suicide are complex and there is no single cause.“The majority of young people who die from suicide have experienced mental health problems or psychological distress,” she says.Risk factors include self-harm, childhood trauma, childhood adversity, and “a family history of mental health and bereavement [or] exposure to suicide”, Robinson says.Bullying, both online and in real life, is also a major concern.Lomas’ mother, Melissa Wilkinson, says her daughter experienced mental health issues and she does not feel she was treated with compassion during hospital visits prior to her death.Skyla Lomas experienced mental health issues before she took her own life.Lomas says she felt it was seen more as “attention-seeking behaviour”.Guardian Australia contacted the Queensland Children’s Hospital for comment.In the years since her daughter’s death, Wilkinson has undertaken suicide intervention training. She believes mental health first aid should be taught in schools.Robinson agrees more resources are needed.“Services are at capacity or over capacity,” she says.“Young people are having to wait far longer than they should to access services like a GP service, a Headspace primary care service, [or] tertiary mental health specialists care when they’re really unwell.”‘She had the biggest heart’Sam Davis lost her 13-year-old daughter, Chloe, to suicide seven years ago.Sam Davis (right) with daughter Chloe who died from suicide aged 13. Photograph: SuppliedAt the time there were rumours that intimate images of Chloe were being circulated online. Police found no evidence of these images and there were no allegations of “sextortion”, but Sam says her daughter was “embarrassed and ashamed”. What drove Chloe to take her own life ultimately remains unknown.Davis says her daughter always wanted to make everyone else happy.“I just felt like she didn’t get that in return. She had the biggest heart.”Chloe wanted to make everyone happy but ‘felt like she didn’t get that in return’, her mother says. Photograph: SuppliedRobinson says one of the biggest reasons that people are calling Kids Helpline at the moment is because of image-based abuse – where intimate photos are shared without consent.Kids Helpline confirmed they have seen a consistent increase in sextortion, receiving 431 reports between July 2017 and June 2023. Prior to January 2021, there were fewer than five reports a month. The organisation is now responding to about 30 reports a month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He described having “crazy” and depressive thoughts and disclosed detoxing from cannabis, according to a coroner’s report.Three days later the 17-year-old attempted suicide near his grandmother’s house and later died in hospital from his injuries.“Josh would have a poker face. So he needed someone like me to essentially translate and advocate for him,” Wharton said.“We’re not taking appropriate actions and we’re not listening to parents.”Joshua Klumper with his mum, Ursula Wharton.Kolves said it can be challenging for health care workers to gauge the needs of neurodiverse people.“Clinicians need to know how to deal with suicide risk,” she says.Wharton was left “disappointed” by a coronial inquest into her son’s death which occurred due to her consistent advocacy.The inquest found that “whilst Josh was experiencing psychological stressors, there is no evidence he was seriously psychiatrically unwell on 2 or 5 September 2017 [in the days before his death]”.Wharton felt the inquest did not “utilise the opportunity” to prevent deaths in similar circumstances.A Gold Coast Health spokesperson said the “coroner found the care provided to this patient was appropriate and made no comments or recommendations”.“ The loss of a loved one to suicide is incredibly distressing and we continue to extend our condolences to Josh’s family.”Helping children ‘discover a way through’Hayley Purdon is a suicide prevention advocate. The 36-year-old developed an eating disorder in high school and experienced suicidal thoughts.“There was a lot of pressure to be perfect … a lot of feelings of shame,” she says.Purdon began the road to recovery after a therapist taught her mindfulness and encouraged her to feel her feelings.“I still sometimes have thoughts of suicide … but I know they’re only temporary and that they will pass.”Parents or guardians supporting children shouldn’t try to “fix them”, Purdon says.“The role when that young person is struggling is not to control their behaviour and to try and fix them or change them,” she says.“It’s just there to help them explore and discover a way through on their own.”"}

NGA director Nick Mitzevich refused to reveal the identities of any of the complainants.On Sunday, Rinehart’s company, Hancock Prospecting, issued a statement – its first since the portrait controversy began – denying Rinehart had initially approached the National Portrait Gallery offering a portrait of herself for its collection. Instead, it was the gallery that first approached her, the statement claimed.“The National Portrait Gallery approached Mrs Rinehart asking if she would sit for a portrait, in or around 2017, perhaps 2018,” the statement said.Gina Rinehart gave portrait of herself to National Portrait Gallery, Senate estimates hears – video“The National Gallery then advised that they wanted this to be done by one of their chosen artists. Mrs Rinehart preferred that a West Australian artist provide the portrait, this being at no cost to the [portrait gallery] and therefore no cost to the taxpayer.”As reported in the Guardian on Friday, these discussions took place several years before the current controversy erupted.“It has been falsely stated or implied in the media, potentially from the way this was discussed in Senate estimates, that the portrait was recently provided to the [portrait gallery],” the Hancock Prospecting statement said, alluding to the inferences made in some media reports that the Rinehart-approved portrait was provided to the National Portrait Gallery in response to the NGA’s portrait.“This is not correct. The portrait was gifted to the [portrait gallery] by Mrs Alix Korte in 2019.”Korte is a Perth-based realist artist and the wife of Hancock Prospecting’s chief executive, Garry Korte.The Hancock Prospecting statement said that Rinehart paid no money to Korte for a series of portraits the artist did prior to 2019. While the billionaire does not know which portrait the artist eventually donated to the National Portrait Gallery, she does recall that all the Korte portraits “were very carefully done and captured in detail her appearance at that time”.On Friday, the director of the gallery, Bree Pickering, told Senate estimates a portrait of Rinehart had been gifted to the board, but did not say when.“The gift came from her,” Pickering told the hearing, referring to Rinehart.“However, as we’ve processed the deed of gift related to that, there were some conditions that came along with that gift that meant those conditions are currently under negotiation.”Pickering added: “We don’t often accept gifts with conditions … we will work with an artist, often, to understand how they would like their artwork displayed.

Last year Trump boasted he could end the war in “24 hours”.Trump’s aides have previously sketched out a possible plan that would involve giving Ukraine’s eastern regions to Russia, as well as Crimea. But Zelenskiy made clear that “Ukrainians would not put up with that”. Nor would they accept a Russian “ultimatum” that forced Ukraine to abandon integration with Europe and future membership of Nato, he said.Zelenskiy acknowledged that a re-elected Trump could, if he really wanted to, impose a crushing military defeat on Ukraine. He could cut off “support, weapons and money”, and even “make deals” with Kyiv’s partners so they stop deliveries of vital arms.“Ukraine, barehanded, without weapons, will not be able to fight a multimillion [Russian] army,” Zelenskiy told the Guardian.Speaking inside his presidential headquarters, he said he thought this scenario was unlikely. But he said if it happened there would be grave consequences for the US’s standing in the world – as well as for Trump personally. “Does he want to become a loser president? Do you understand what can happen?” Zelenskiy said.He predicted that Vladimir Putin would violate any Trump-brokered deal. “A ceasefire is a trap,” he said. After a pause Putin would “go further”, humiliating Trump and making him look “very weak” in the eyes of the world, he said.Zelenskiy continued: “This is not about him [Trump], as a person but about the institutions of the United States. They will become very weak. The US will not be the leader of the world any more. Yes, it will be powerful, first of all, in the domestic economy because it has a powerful economy without a doubt. But in terms of international influence it will be equal to zero.”Realising that Washington was no longer “a player”, other mostly authoritarian countries and leaders would “come into the arena” and emulate Putin’s aggressive “approach”, Zelenskiy suggested.And this would ultimately end in global disaster: “The beginning of what everyone is so afraid to talk about. This is reality. And this is the real third world war.”Asked whether Johnson had spoken to Trump on Ukraine’s behalf, Zelenskiy said: “I think he tried, and I think he spoke to him. I think so, yes, as far as I know.”He added: “I am sorry that I am using Boris as an instrument.”skip past newsletter promotionOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The $61bn military aid package passed in April after a six-month delay.Zelenskiy made his comments a day before a New York jury on Thursday convicted Trump of all 34 counts of falsifying business records. The verdict in the hush-money trial made him the first former president to be found guilty of felony crimes in the US’s near 250-year history.In 2019, as president, Trump rang Zelenskiy and asked him to investigate his election rival Biden and Biden’s son Hunter. If Zelenskiy failed to find dirt on Hunter Biden, US security assistance to Ukraine would be withheld, Trump suggested, according to a leak of the call. The scandal led to Trump’s first impeachment.Zelenskiy said he had invited Trump to visit Ukraine. “I want to talk to him openly. I want him to come and see the war for himself. And then to talk to him. I think he would need it to understand the situation better,” he said.Zelenskiy said he understood that Trump “knows” Putin, based on the former president’s own “statements”. The pair have met at diplomatic summits. Trump has previously called Russia’s leader “a genius” and described his 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine as “pretty savvy”.Communicating with Putin was not the same as knowing him, Zelenskiy said, adding that to understand him better Trump should “see the results of what he brought to Ukraine” – a reference to the destruction of towns and cities, murders of civilians and the daily bombardment from Russian missiles."}

The clue is in the use of numbers and letters.In listing “primary considerations” for the home affairs department and the AAT to weigh up in making these decisions, the executive government intended them to be ranked in descending order.The department (and presumably the AAT) didn’t automatically do that because that’s not what its written direction expressly says.This is about the wording in ministerial direction 99, the guide used by the minister’s departmental delegates in the first instance to decide if there are good reasons to overturn a convicted criminal’s visa cancellation. Where the delegates decide the cancellation should proceed, the same direction is then used by members of the AAT who adjudicate on appeals to those decisions.Section 501 of the Migration Act triggers the cancellation process when a visa holder is convicted of an offence punishable by 12 months or more in jail.But the law also provides some wriggle room, in the form of a ministerial direction setting out issues to be considered in deciding if the person should indeed be deported or can stay.Albanese announces reversal of ministerial ruling that saw criminals given visas – videoMinisterial direction 99 lists five “primary considerations”. Issued in January last year, it updated the Morrison government’s version, direction 90, which had four.Those were: the protection of the community; whether the offending conduct involved family violence; the best interests of minor children in the person’s family; and community expectations.These conditions were numbered one to four in that order.At the instruction of Albanese, the immigration minister amended that – creating direction 99 – to add one further consideration: the “strength, nature and duration” of the person’s ties to Australia.He slotted it in at number three.The numbering and the fact that it was dropped into the middle of the list, not just added on at the end, indicate these considerations were meant to be weighted in that order. It suggests the government thought it more important than the two below it.That seems to be what the government intended. But it simply assumed that’s how it would be read – the order does not spell it out.Instead, it says only that “one or more primary considerations may outweigh other primary considerations”. In other words, the deciders can weigh them up against one another and decide their relative importance. It doesn’t say that number one is meant to be number one.But Watt’s comments on Sunday suggest that’s what the government intended.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was always our intention that community safety would be a primary consideration.”What he means is that it was intended to be the primary consideration of the primary considerations. First among equals. Number one.But Guardian Australia understands decision-makers viewed them as being equal because nothing expressly ranked them in priority order. The direction was not clear on this point.Possibly supporting the suggestion that the government thought they would be seen as being ranked in order, the “other considerations” are listed differently.These are not numbered. They are listed by bracketed letters – a, b, c, etc – suggesting they’re a bunch of equal also-ran factors.On that list are: any legal consequences of the decision; the extent of impediments if the person is removed; the impact on victims; and the impact on Australian business interests.The existing direction 99, which runs to 24 pages, also lays out detailed principles the decision-makers should follow in weighing the considerations.“In some circumstances, the nature of the non-citizen’s conduct, or the harm that would be caused if the conduct were to be repeated, may be so serious that even strong countervailing considerations may be insufficient to justify not cancelling or refusing the visa, or revoking a mandatory cancellation,” the last listed principle says.To explain further, it suggests, for example, that in a case involving family violence where there is no evidence that the person poses a further risk, the community’s expectations on such matters may nevertheless need to prevail. This suggests that even if the listed factors are meant to be weighted by their numbered order, sometimes if number two and number five align, they may outweigh number one.Common sense is not mentioned. The government assumed it was implied.Giles and Albanese have now indicated the soon-to-be revised version of ministerial direction 99 will put a premium on community protection. Giles has said it will also deal with “some additional concerns that we see around victims and their families”.Expect, at the very least, a line to be added saying the primary considerations should be weighted by their numbered order, which already has community protection first, if not placing it more expressly on its own. And the particular “other” consideration mentioning victims may now be either elevated to the first list or expressly emphasised within the second.Sometimes, even common sense requires clearer direction."}

The successful candidate, 31-year-old Amelia Hamer, is unlikely to step aside and says the changes to the boundaries of Kooyong may work in her favour.Frydenberg, the former treasurer and deputy Liberal leader, was defeated in 2022 by independent Monique Ryan and took a lucrative job at Goldman Sachs after leaving politics.Friday’s proposed redistribution of Victorian seats abolished the seat of Higgins and made major changes to borders of other Melbourne electorates. The ABC reported Frydenberg was considering trying to run again, but would need the Victorian Liberal party to reopen nominations – a prospect strongly rebuffed by several Victorian Liberal sources on Sunday.Guardian Australia spoke to numerous Liberal MPs and party sources, both inside and outside Victoria, about the prospect of Frydenberg’s return. Opinions were split, with some supportive, while others strongly urged against the idea of unseating the endorsed candidate.One MP said it would be a “terrible look” to ask Hamer to step aside, noting perceptions of the party having internal issues with gender equality. Several said women in the party had “frustrations” about accessing opportunities for advancement and preselection, and that passing over Hamer would not soothe such concerns.Charlotte Mortlock, founder of the Hilma’s Network advocacy group for Liberal women, said Frydenberg “had ample opportunity months ago” to run.“Amelia is the exact demographic we need to win back. She is a more competitive candidate,” Mortlock told Guardian Australia.“It is grossly condescending to expect or even ask a woman of her calibre to make way for a man because he’s changed his mind four months later.”Mortlock’s comments came after former Liberal MP Jason Falinski called Hamer “a team player and she would understand we want to put our best people on the field”.Others spoken to by Guardian Australia said it would be unfair to reopen preselection in Kooyong, considering other seats – like Deakin, Chisholm and Menzies – had been altered to similar or higher degrees. They questioned if the party would throw open ballots in all affected seats.Simon Holmes à Court, a vocal critic of Frydenberg and convener of the Climate 200 funding vehicle, which backed “teal” MPs like Ryan to win Kooyong, tweeted a gif of an animal eating popcorn in response to the latest Frydenberg news.Another Liberal MP said they would like to see former Liberal MP Katie Allen, the endorsed candidate for the seat of Higgins, get another chance at running, potentially in Kooyong. Allen lost Higgins to Labor MP Michelle Ananda-Rajah in 2022, but large parts of Higgins have been redistributed into Kooyong.Former cabinet minister Karen Andrews, who will retire at the next election, told Nine newspapers Frydenberg was “someone we need to bring back into the Liberal Party and into federal politics”, adding the party had an “opportunity to revisit” the situation.Frydenberg, Hamer and Allen were contacted for comment, as was the Victorian Liberal party.skip past newsletter promotionOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hamer on Sunday tweeted a photo with a constituent, with the text “Women can do anything!”“Here in Kooyong the community loves to support strong women.”On Saturday, she posted a Facebook photo while campaigning alongside Allen, saying she was familiar with the new suburbs Kooyong would now take in.“It’s an area I know well: I’ve previously lived there, I went to school at St Catherine’s in Toorak, and many years ago I was a waitress at an Italian bistro in Malvern! However nothing is finalised until October, so in the meantime our focus is the same - getting out and about and listening to the community,” she said.Allen, posting the same photo on her Facebook, wrote: “Higgins is not gone yet - the AEC document is still just a draft. We are still campaigning for local Liberal values.”Other Liberal sources said the party knew it was a risk to hold preselections before the redistribution was finalised, noting fears about exactly this kind of situation. Several claimed it would be “unprecedented” to reopen nominations, and feared voters would punish the party if it did so.One MP said some in the party were displeased at constant speculation about Frydenberg’s political future, saying it was unhelpful to Liberal prospects. Frydenberg has not commented publicly on his future political ambitions, but MPs told Guardian Australia he has not ruled out running again.But other MPs backed the idea of reopening preselections if Frydenberg did change his mind after the redistribution. One Coalition MP, from outside Victoria, said they believed Kooyong voters may support Frydenberg more strongly as the candidate, considering his status as a potential future Liberal leader or senior minister.That MP said the Liberals needed to “get serious” about winning government, and that recruiting Frydenberg and winning seats like Kooyong would be crucial in that quest."}

As her billion-dollar Eras tour lands in the UK, we trace the making of the Swift universe", "author": "Kitty Empire", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/02/taylor-swift-impact-records-eras-tour", "text": "How to write about the biggest, most written-about star in the world as summer 2024 approaches, and with it the arrival of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour in the UK later this week? We could take cues from the normally level-headed New Yorker. But even they recently threw up their hands and pronounced Swift as beyond review – not because reviewers might get doxxed by overzealous Swifties if they dare give her fewer than five stars, but because Swift’s work might officially be beyond good and evil.The New Yorker’s Sinéad O’Sullivan contends that Swift is operating so far outside the norm for pop that assessing her output as mere songs is futile: she has created a Marvel-style universe all her own, in which complex internal references abound and the identity of her enemies, and the 3D chess games she is playing, are pored over across the social mediasphere. Teenage girls and young women, it turns out, are not passive consumers of glittery froth, but supercharged Dylanologists crossed with ninja cryptographers, operating at an emotional pitch on the scale of Beatlemania.Country girl: Taylor Swift wins a best country song Grammy for White Horse in 2010. Photograph: Danny Moloshok/ReutersSwift not only has lore, she embarks on her multi-platform art knowingly, laying a trail of Easter eggs and numerological puzzles. She is also, of course, beyond interview, a “post-media” celebrity who does not have much use for middle-people. But in a rare 2023 exchange with Time magazine (when she was named person of the year) she discussed her emotive and canny album re-recording campaign to gain control of her masters – Taylor’s Versions – being like a mythical quest. “I’m collecting horcruxes,” Swift said, eyebrow only slightly raised. “I’m collecting infinity stones. Gandalf’s voice is in my head every time I put out a new one. For me, it is a movie now.”In this universe, from news stories about her latest Swiftonomics milestone, to fan theories shared and dissected at light-speed, to university courses and symposia, the mass of Swift exegesis is weighty. This is, yes, yet another op-ed to toss on to a vast pile, but still it remains worth examining the phenomenon of a singer-songwriter who has become far, far more than just that. Swift’s fans cheer so loudly they twice registered as an earthquake on the Richter scale in the US last year. Donald Trump allies have threatened to wage “holy war” against Swift if she endorses Joe Biden for the US presidency. “Biggest gangsta in the music game right now,” Drake recently called her.Drake considers Swift his only real competition but really, it’s not even close. A number-soup of statistics, of umpteen records broken and most-streamed this, or online reach that, supports Swift’s dominance. Her Eras tour looks set to be the highest-grossing of all time, tilting the financial tectonics of entire cities: Barclays has estimated that her shows here might be worth £1bn to the UK economy. The Swift lift is real: she has made American football, that most popular US sport, even more popular. Her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, plays for the Kansas City Chiefs; it’s been calculated that Swift has generated an additional $331.5m for the NFL between 24 September last year and 22 January this year.Trump allies have warned her to stay out of politics. What’s extraordinary is that everyone believes that she can swing the electionThe Swift lift could be political too. “I can’t comment on what Taylor Swift is saying, or not saying,” said a White House spokesperson in March, on whether Swift will endorse Biden this year; hilarious, if the context weren’t so charged. The star did endorse him in 2020 and Swift is, apparently, sky-high on Biden’s team’s wishlist. (She may be reticent to endorse a figure known to Palestinian supporters as “Genocide Joe”.) Fox News, meanwhile, has called Swift “a Pentagon psyop asset” and Trump allies have warned her to stay out of politics. What’s extraordinary is that everyone believes that she can swing the election.What’s even more remarkable is how Swift manages to be a significant geopolitical and macroeconomic disrupter, while simultaneously cultivating an insightful, sensitive relatability. She is “your billionaire best friend”, according to Georgia Carroll, who spoke at the recent Australian Swiftposium; a star who made her money on the back of her songwriting (not by diversifying her portfolio into drinks, makeup or NFTs) and by leveraging the obsessiveness of her fans to consume multiple formats of her output. “My Pennies Made Your Crown” completes the keynote speech’s title (it’s a Taylor Swift lyric); Carroll’s thesis examined what expenditure does to cultural capital within the fan community. Swift has been likened to a capitalist role model thanks to endless limited edition releases and merch drops, and her indefatigable work ethic: she has released five studio albums in the past five years, alongside four complete Taylor’s Version re-recordings. (Recently, Billie Eilish called out as “wasteful” unnamed other pop stars releasing multiple colours of the same vinyl record; Eilish’s vinyl is recycled.)With discussion of Swift’s work and life powering several server farms’ worth of internet fan activity, it becomes harder to get your head around this epically unprecedented state of affairs. If the Kansas City Chiefs are not really in Kansas any more, Toto, then neither are the rest of us.Swift’s exceptionalism, though, is well founded on both talent and tactics, and in the singular journey she has had through the past couple of high-churn decades. Ironically, given she dominates our age, Swift is actually a profoundly old-fashioned artist who would have made a great Broadway librettist. Unlike a lot of modern pop, her songs tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously, a legacy of her country beginnings. But Daddy I Love Him, off The Tortured Poets Department, is a vexed love story complete with meddling onlookers that may have nodded to Swift’s troubled relationship with the 1975’s Matty Healy. She quotes The Little Mermaid, wrongfoots expectations – “I’m having his baby/No I’m not, but you should see your faces” – and nonchalantly tosses off the line “all the wine moms are still holding out/But fuck ’em”.When we’re repeatedly told that the value of recorded music has never been lower and that it is consumed largely as snippets on TikTok, Swift releases double albums that are events themselves; her body of work is studied as a whole. In a time where people engage with highly individualised content on their phones, Swift’s releases, gigs and pronouncements provide mass moments as stans, lighter-touch fans and onlookers race to digest her latest output, or decode a cryptic post.But Swift is also profoundly of this era, where fame has significantly altered – especially for female pop artists. It has become more intense, bloodthirsty and fickle. The leftfield singer-songwriter and musician Ethel Cain, in a recent interview with the Guardian, suggested that fans nowadays treat female pop artists “like fantasy football teams”, arguing “about streams and stats and followers and almost using them like Pokémon to fight each other”. Swift knows a little about that. Her current level of adulation has been hard won; back in 2016, the hashtag #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty trended, after a series of dramas, conflicts and PR nadirs where the Taylor avatar took a drubbing. That all seems very long ago now; you might quip that Swift’s narrative arc has been long, but it has bent towards justice, and – crucial to her ubiquity now – that justice has coded female.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionSwift saw off a groping male DJ in court in 2017. A convoluted and ugly multi-part saga involving Kanye West and his former wife, Kim Kardashian, has ended with Swift vindicated, and with Ye losing big brand endorsements after a series of antisemitic statements. Swift also creatively faced down the controversial pop manager Scooter Braun, who bought the masters of her back catalogue out from under her when he acquired her old label. (He has since sold the label and the masters; Braun’s other crime was being a Ye ally). Many of Braun’s premier clients – Justin Bieber, Demi Lovato and Ariana Grande – are now working with others.Swift has survived physical, legal and financial assaults. She proves the creeps are beatable, which is news we can useStars are, to some extent, two-dimensional characters; they are projections. But stars are also mirrors, reflecting back at us what we want – or need – to see. And what Swift’s many fans see is a woman whose songwriting reflects their concerns. She writes about the anticipation and disappointments of romantic love, privileging the intensity of the female experience but also all aspects of her complex story. There is, perhaps, a yawning unmet need now for an avenging angel such as Swift in the wake of the overturn of Roe v Wade – Swift speedily tweeted her “absolutely terrified” reaction – and the anti-choice legislation under way in various states.Purple train: on stage in Lisbon during the Eras tour, 24 May 2024. Photograph: Pedro Gomes/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights ManagementBut if Swift’s saga skews female, her feminism does have shortcomings: it’s been criticised for its paleness, despite some timely social media action at the time of #BlackLivesMatter, her embrace of Juneteenth and her friendship with Beyoncé. In the Q&A after her opening address to the recent Melbourne Swiftposium, senior Rolling Stone writer Brittany Spanos, a Black Swiftie, expressed some personal discomfort; that Swift had ground to make up. There is, categorically, more that Swift could do on many fronts. Since her outburst in the Miss Americana documentary (2020), in which she argued with her father and other managers about supporting Democratic candidates in a local Tennessee election in 2018, her public commitments to social justice seem to have dropped off somewhat.But key to her dominance is her own story: Swift has been cancelled, and risen, phoenix-like; surviving physical, legal and financial assaults. She proves the creeps are beatable, which is news we can use. More than just some idealised gracious Athene, Swift has access to reserves of Boudicca and Joan of Arc. It’s all been a postmodern hero’s quest, with a woman at its heart. All entertainment is, inherently, distraction from more important things; circuses have traditionally come a close second to bread in the hierarchy of needs to avoid a descent into anarchy. But we need them. A tremendous multi-ring, multi-level circus is coming to town, and Swift is its vindicated ringmaster."}

He announced last year that he would no longer be playing the saxophone live. For his solo debut album, Perceive Its Beauty, Acknowledge Its Grace, released on Impulse! in April, he uses different types of flute and the clarinet. This summer and autumn Shabaka tours the US, Canada and Europe, including the Montreal international jazz festival. He is pictured here with a shakuhachi, a traditional Japanese bamboo fluteThis is one of the more difficult instruments to play that I own. It was given to me by an instrument-maker and shakuhachi player in Japan, Katsuya Nonaka. A year and a half ago, I travelled to Japan to meet him to talk about harvesting and making my own shakuhachi. We went to a bamboo forest and started the process of selecting the bamboo – it had to be the right age because of the moisture, and had to be suitable for my hand – and we dug it out of the ground from the roots. Then you burn the shakuhachi to get the initial oil out, and you leave it to cure for a year. I went back a year later and finished the process: I made three shakuhachis, and harvested four more on that trip. I’ll be going back to Japan later this year for the process of boring the holes and making the mouthpiece for those. By December, I should have made seven instruments.It is daunting to go to an instrument as a complete beginner. It took me a year to make a consistent sound on itWhile I was waiting for those first bamboos to cure, Katsuya gave me one of his own shakuhachis, which is the one in the picture. I’ve had shakuhachis before, but this is the biggest, and the most difficult to play. This is purely a practice instrument: I never play it live, and didn’t use it on the new album – on the tune Insecurities, I use an antique, 100-year-old shakuhachi. This is a private tool for me. I’ll warm up on it if I’m doing long tones in the morning or breathwork. Paradoxically, a bigger instrument doesn’t mean it is louder. But in terms of the low frequencies, it’s really pleasurable to play.I got my first shakuhachi in Japan in 2019, when I was at the Fuji rock festival. I’d heard about it before and knew it had a cool sound, but I was very much an outsider. It is daunting and really humbling to go to an instrument and be a complete beginner. It took me a year to make a consistent sound on it; to put it to my lips and know, this is the sound I’m going to get. When I managed, it felt really great. There’s something really pleasurable about being able to sit with such a low vibration noise. When it’s resonating correctly, the way it makes you feel is, for me, unsurpassed by any other instrument I’ve played. There isn’t any mechanism or technology: it’s just one piece of material.Shabaka with his shakuhachi. Photograph: Amit LennonThe shakuhachi was used by Buddhist monks as a meditation tool for many centuries before it was a performative device. You can see why: there’s something very centring and grounding about it. Katsuya told me about a technique that’s been passed down to him, which is playing the lowest note for a couple of hours, thinking about how the note emerges from nothing to something and then back to nothing. This instrument in particular is great for that: to sit with long tones for long periods of time and just bliss out.Is the flute having a moment? It’s an interesting question. Lizzo’s been playing the flute for a while – she plays the classical flute. André 3000 [who last November released the flute-centred album New Blue Sun] concentrates on the Native American flute variety. The thing with the flute is that it’s cathartic. It’s one of the oldest instruments: I guess the voice is the first, and then maybe percussion elements, but when it comes to actually using a part of the natural environment to amplify the sound you’re hearing in your head, the flute’s the oldest instrument that they found. From all the conversations I’ve had with André, it feels like that’s the vibe: you pick up the flute, make little melodies, and discover what the flute has to tell you.I’m not playing saxophone any more, but in the past year or so I was practising so much shakuhachi that it really increased my saxophone technique. It develops the muscles around your mouth a lot more than the sax does – it’s a very small focused stream of air that forces you to get very in tune with what your body is doing. What I found in going to the flute from the saxophone and clarinet is that it feels better to inhabit the quieter dynamic realm – it’s almost more natural. It means I can be out in public, in nature, and be playing to myself without feeling that my sound is dominating the space.A lot of the practise I do is in the bathroom – the tiling means you get a nice reverb, and it’s good to look at the mirror to see what my technique’s doing – or I’ll be playing in hotel fire exits. So it’s been good to actually perform live with a microphone. Actually, at the moment, I put three mics in front of the flute, so I can get triple the amount of level. I’m not actually playing very loud at all, but I’m able to project over a large distance. That’s something I saw in a Björk interview, when she was talking about [her album] Vespertine, and amplifying very quiet sounds so that they become big gestures. I’m really looking forward to doing a 12-gig, six-night residency at the Blue Note jazz club in New York this September. It’s the first time I’ll have done six nights in one club: it means I’ll really understand the space and how to manipulate the resonance.If this shakuhachi got lost or broken, it would be pretty tragic. Any of these instruments that are made by specific pieces of bamboo, they’re irreplaceable – you’ll never get a piece of bamboo exactly the same. All my instruments are very specific to me in terms of what they mean, and the stories behind them, and how much time I’ve spent on each of them. So if I lost one, that’s the end of my story with that instrument. But if an instrument-sized hole appears in my life, there are always other instruments that come to the rescue. Kathryn BromwichCorinne Bailey Rae on her Marxophone: ‘I like that it doesn’t feel competitive. It’s very tactile, you can get straight to it’Corinne Bailey Rae with her Marxophone. Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverBorn in Leeds in 1979, Corinne Bailey Rae is best known for her soulful early singles Like a Star and Put Your Records On, which propelled her self-titled debut album to a UK No 1 in 2006. Lately her sound has become more raucous and experimental: her 2023 album Black Rainbows was described in a five-star Observer review as an “audacious mix of rock, electronica, jazz and Afrofuturism”. She lives in Leeds with her musician husband Steve Brown and their two daughters. This summer she is playing a slew of festivals including Glastonbury (29 June), Latitude (26 July) and We Out Here (17 August)In 2007, shortly after my first album came out and I had a bit of cash in my pocket, I went into a vintage guitar shop in Los Angeles. Those kinds of places always scare me, because I’m not a technical guitarist and the people who work there are usually dudes. There were all these expensive guitars hanging up, and then there was this strange-looking instrument on a shelf, called a Marxophone. I asked if I could try it and the guy looked at me as if to say “another timewaster who wants to check this out but won’t actually buy it”. I played it for a while and he gave me another look and I took great pleasure in saying: “Yeah, I’ll take it.”The Marxophone was patented by an American inventor called Henry Charles Marx in 1912 and manufactured by a couple of different companies until the 1950s – mine was made in Jersey City. It’s a soundboard that has a group of 16 strings on the left that are arranged in four bass notes with triads for each note. And then on the right there are 15 pairs of strings running from low to high that are struck by hammers that bounce as you press them, in quite a hard-to-control way.I find it transporting and otherworldly… it’s a really mysterious, open-to-possibilities instrumentI love how the strings are arranged and that you can play it in different ways – sometimes I ignore the keys altogether and play it like a harp. I find it really transporting and otherworldly. If you’re a person who writes songs, sometimes sitting down with a guitar feels like you’re clicking into work mode. The Marxophone is different. I’ve never written anything on it. I find myself able to play and sing and just be transported.It reminds me of when I used to find and make instruments as a child. One time I found a metal shoe tree in our garage at home. I took it on to the drive and sat on a stool and started playing all these little bits of metal that had slightly different tones. Time disappeared: it was just me doing this thing and getting lost in it. That’s the moment I look for on stage – when, after three or four songs, you’re not concentrating on making the thing happen, it’s just happening. And that’s what I find I can really quickly get to with the Marxophone, because it’s just such a weirdo instrument.It didn’t take long to learn. Anyone can make a sound on it. Perhaps there are people who’ve mastered it – a Jimi Hendrix of the Marxophone – but I’m not aware of them. I like that it doesn’t feel competitive. It’s very tactile, you can get straight to it.I’ve put moments of it on songs – on Low Red Moon from The Love EP in 2011, for example. I wonder if I should use it more. But the thing that draws me to it is the unrepeatableness of it. So a thing that I might play on it today, I might not be able to remember tomorrow – or I might not feel like doing the same thing again, because it’s a really mysterious, open-to-possibilities instrument.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionI’ve never taken my Marxophone on stage. There’s always a first time I guess. But it’s not very easy to transport. I could just imagine opening the flight case and finding it all bashed up, with strings everywhere. It’s really fragile. And there’s an intimacy about it that I really like. What I do on it doesn’t have to be liked or approved of or even shared. I’d really hate to lose it. Killian FoxNilüfer Yanya on her Fender Stratocaster: ‘The way the guitar looks is very important to me’Nilüfer Yanya with her guitar. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverBorn in 1995 and raised in west London, Nilüfer Yanya put out three EPs before releasing her first album, Miss Universe, in 2019 to widespread acclaim – the Guardian called its “skewed alt-rock” the work of “a true original”. She followed it up in 2022 with Painless, a more cohesive and stripped-back record that featured on many best-of-year lists. Her latest single, Like I Say (I Runaway), is out now on Ninja Tune, and Yanya will play Rally festival in Southwark Park, London, on 24 AugustMy first instrument was piano. I started playing when I was six and put in a lot of effort, going up to grade eight, but for me the guitar was much cooler. I was into skater-punk bands like Blink-182 and I just really loved the idea of playing guitar. It fitted better with the ideas for songs that I had in my head.The first time I played, aged nine or 10, was with a random broken guitar that a family member gave to my sister. Later, I found a guitar on Gumtree and trekked across London to collect it. It cost around £60 and it was just terrible. The bag smelled like cat pee. Later I got a Japanese copy of a Burns that was a bit more reliable, but it still wasn’t very good.My playing improved at high school. I went to a very musical school called Pimlico [now Pimlico Academy] and my first guitar teacher was Dave Okumu, who studied at the same school and went on to form the Invisible. His classes were super-creative.I love playing guitar on stage. It makes sense and feels like an extension of yourselfWhen I was 16, I discovered the Pixies, and something about their guitar sound really appealed to me. A year later I bought Lianne La Havas’s first album. Her playing felt a lot more intricate, and I felt attached to that as well. Also it was nice to see a woman with a guitar – there weren’t many female guitar players in the bands I listened to, like the Strokes, the Cure or the Pixies.When I first started writing songs as a kid, I’d write the melodies and lyrics in a notebook. Then I started transferring the ideas to the guitar, and that helped me develop my own style. The physicality is nice: it makes the song you’re writing feel less abstract and more tangible. Even just holding a guitar, I’m thinking more intuitively about melodies, and everything feels a bit more natural.I love playing guitar on stage. I love that feeling when you’re just totally locked in, not even thinking about what you’re playing. It’s almost like simpler guitar parts carry the most weight. I mean, everyone loves a cool solo, but with my own playing I feel most attached to the instrument when there’s nothing remarkable happening. It just makes sense and it feels connected. The guitar feels like an extension of yourself.I remember playing my Strat at one of my first proper headline shows, at EartH in Hackney in 2019. I had been playing this guitar for years and I had a very honest, uncomplicated relationship with it. It was reliable and affordable – and pearly blue with a subtle sparkle which was very “me” at the time. I’d write, record and tour all on the same instrument – I don’t even remember thinking about any other guitars. The show at EartH is still one of my favourites – it was the first time I felt almost comfortable being on stage. But shortly after the gig I started playing a rose-gold Fender Jazzmaster, so my uninterrupted Strat era came to an end. I’d seen a few people playing Jazzmasters and I was eager to try something different. It felt good and natural to play.Of course, things can go wrong. At a show in Istanbul on our last big tour, I broke the strings on the final song and didn’t have any spares, so they ran around the venue and found this random, weird-looking guitar. I didn’t think I’d be able to finish the show, but actually it was really fun. When you’ve practised enough, and you’ve got enough adrenaline, everything’s fine.I’m not a guitar nerd. I wouldn’t trawl through guitar magazines for new technology. But the way the guitar looks is very important to me – most of the guitars I’ve owned have been blue. And the type of guitars I play has changed over the years. For the longest time, a Fender Strat was my guitar, then recently I started playing a Gibson SG, which has a different sound, a different energy – it’s associated with classic rock. But the Jazzmaster is probably the nicest guitar I’ve ever had. You’ve got to keep evolving. KF"}

I felt so isolated. He would question ‘what are you doing?’ and say ‘if you dare go out, I’ll get you killed’,” she tells Guardian Australia of the months before the trip.That trip would also allow her to re-enter Australia on a new tourist visa, before the one she held expired and while she waited for her partner visa application to be assessed.But the day before they were due to fly out, her husband – an Australian citizen – left their home and didn’t return. After hours of waiting, she says she received a break-up text from him – and a warning to leave the country.Priya says that with her visa about to expire, she believed she had no option but to depart Australia. So after reaching Thailand, she flew back to her home country in south Asia.Amid a spate of horrific domestic violence killings in Australia, migration and trafficking experts say there is a hidden crisis where women, typically those already subject to domestic violence, are tricked, threatened or forced into leaving Australia. Technically called exit trafficking, the practice is illegal and is treated as a form of people trafficking under commonwealth law.Last financial year alone, the Australian federal police received 30 reports of exit trafficking. But research has estimated only 20% of human trafficking and slavery cases in Australia are detected.In April, the first Victorian to be charged with exit trafficking was found guilty by a jury of leaving his wife stranded in South Sudan without her passport. He flew back with the couple’s children and it took his wife two years to return to Australia. He faces 12 years behind bars.‘Nothing I could do’Speaking via an interpreter, Lee* says she was trafficked out of Australia by her then husband last year.She says the man, an Australian citizen, told her they needed to return to her home country for a few months because her mother-in-law’s visa was about to expire.But he had only booked a one-way ticket for Lee.“I was suspicious but there was nothing I could do,” she says. “I didn’t know anyone here.”A few months after returning to south Asia, Lee contacted a health service that she had used in Australia and was eventually connected to inTouch, a family violence service for migrant and refugee women. inTouch helped her return to Australia and get permanent residency.Lina Garcia Daza, who leads the Australian Red Cross’s federally funded Support for Trafficked People program, says it received 16 referrals for exit trafficking last year. Almost 90% of clients referred to the program after experiencing exit trafficking are women.The program provides a range of support including financial assistance, accommodation, medical treatment, counselling and referrals to legal and migration assistance.“Safety is a big issue. Usually they are escaping a situation of violence. They may arrive in Australia fearful of authorities and of reprisal, especially if they have dependent children,” she says.“They arrive to the country again, knowing they may not be able to go to the same neighbourhood where they used to live or for their children to attend the same school. It’s usually a big challenge.”An AFP spokesperson said over the past five years, Australia has seen an overall annual increase in the number of exit trafficking reports. In the 2018-19 financial year there were just 13 reported cases.The spokesperson said prosecuting exit trafficking cases presents a “significant challenge” to the AFP due to the under-reporting of crimes, which is exacerbated by victims’ lack of awareness of their rights under Australian law, fear of retribution, and language barriers.“Additionally the prosecution process is hindered by legal and evidentiary hurdles including issues such as evidence collection from other nations and the reliance on victim testimony, which can be challenging to obtain,” the spokesperson said.Visa abuseOnce abroad some victim-survivors contact Australian authorities, including the Department of Home Affairs, the AFP or a consulate, in search of help.Others may never make it back to Australia.Priya spent months researching her legal rights before flying back to Australia on a tourist visa – determined to stay in the country she had begun to think of as home. She returned with only the suitcase she had left with and her identity documents.A chance encounter with a family violence worker in a Melbourne park led her to be connected to accommodation and legal support.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In recent years the legal centre has seen more sophisticated techniques of visa abuse, including the perpetrators controlling a person’s online immigration portal, allowing them to manipulate their dependent’s visa outcome without the victim knowing.“It’s not uncommon to hear the perpetrator provide misinformation such as ‘to get your visa, you have to stay with me’,” she says.“So there’s a lot of misinformation. It sounds very convincing. And they say it in such a way that they’re consistently providing this information so that they believe all of that.”Protection for temporary visa holdersOnly select visas in Australia, including the partner visa, have family violence provisions for applicants, meaning there is a pathway to permanent residency if a person can demonstrate their sponsor perpetrated violence against them during their relationship.“[Priya] is actually one of the more fortunate clients that we have been able to assist, in terms of legal options available to her,” Vejar says.She says the legal centre has advocated for a temporary family violence visa and for family violence provisions to be extended to all visa categories as well as for the Department of Home Affairs to communicate with all visa applicants over the age of 18, to ensure they know what is happening with their application.Anti-Slavery Australia, a human rights centre at the University of Technology Sydney that runs a legal practice, identified the first case of exit trafficking that resulted in prosecution in 2017, after a referral from a community agency..It resulted in the AFP laying charges that led to the first conviction of exit trafficking in Australia in 2021.Prof Jennifer Burn, director of Anti-Slavery Australia, says exit trafficking is particularly invisible when it occurs within domestic relationships.“This might be in the circumstances of a foreign national sponsored to Australia on a partner visa, who is then trafficked overseas at a later point.” she says.“The widespread lack of awareness around exit trafficking means that this cohort is unlikely to know that what they have experienced is a crime and that they have rights and entitlements under Australian law,” she says.Burn, a law professor at UTS, says the most common form of exit trafficking the organisation has seen is cases of young female Australian citizens and residents trafficked overseas for a forced marriage.“We have also seen a rise in women being trafficked overseas by their intimate partners. Generally these women are on temporary visas or partner visas,” she says.Priya was recently granted permanent residency and is now focused on rebuilding her life in Australia with hopes of studying migration law one day.“I want to help people who are trapped in this complex system. They should be able to seek justice.”*Names have been changed"}

Obviously I loved the Spice Girls and stuff like that, and I remember having Lauryn Hill when I was a little kid – but it wasn’t really mine, it was my mum’s and I took it.I was five when I bought the Fiona Apple album, which is crazy. I used to watch MTV all the time and record the music videos on a VCR. The Criminal video – I was obsessed. I still have the VHS at my grandmother’s house. I was definitely an MTV child because my parents were pretty young when they had me, so I don’t think they were really censoring me.In a lot of ways I write visually – when I’m doing a song, I see it more in music videos. It’s funny; I feel like I haven’t been able or allowed to make many music videos. But when I have, I’ve tried to make the most out of it. It’s pretty important to me.It’s been just over a decade since you released Night Time, My Time. What do you do at night when you can’t get to sleep?I actually don’t sleep very much. Sleeping has always been very difficult for me. I have to have sound on but it can’t be music because then I’ll just start thinking and hearing everything in music terms. So I usually play podcasts or audiobooks; a lot of autobiographies or old radio shows, or Orson Welles or something. I was falling asleep for a long time to a Lauren Bacall book because I like the sound of her voice. There’s something hypnotic about it.What’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever received?Jon Brion gave this advice to me when I was 17: write the way you speak. That changed my songwriting and my life in a way. It really opened my mind up. It’s so simple and so stupid – I was already doing that, but there was always a part of me that was like “All of these lyrics are dumb” because I thought they were too simple.What song do you want played at your funeral?I don’t know! I don’t want to die. I don’t want to live forever but I’m terrified of dying. I’m not one of those people who’s like “Die young!” or something. Or “if it happens, it happens”. Like, no! I’m not trying to die. I’m always scared I’m gonna die, all the time. It’s always at the back of my head. I’m not one to accept death.What is your secret party trick?It’s not meant to be hot or sexy or a pickup thing – but I do know how to tie a cherry stem. I’m not bragging about it! It’s because I have a lot of weird little gaps in my teeth – random ones that people really don’t see. Really, that helps.What’s the worst job you’ve ever had?This is so dumb but it’s whenever I’ve had to be in something really bad or shoot something insane – like bad films. Because you just know it. You go: I didn’t want to do this, I knew I shouldn’t have done this, I don’t remember who talked me into this. That sounds ridiculous but I’ve just been doing music for ever. I started doing this when I was 13. My concept of a bad job is just not that bad in reality.You have a beloved track called Everything is Embarrassing. But what is the most embarrassing thing you’ve ever done?I feel like I’m constantly humiliating myself at all times. So it’s really hard to pinpoint it. I feel like I’m humiliating myself half the time I’m playing – it’s turning into a thing where I don’t realise I’m apologising all the time. But I’m also like: don’t tell me what to do!Is there a film that scarred you as a child?I saw The Exorcist when I was seven, when I was with my cousin at a friend’s house. I used to sleepwalk as a kid and the film horrified me. In my mind, I was like, “Is that what sleepwalking is? You’re possessed?!” I still have a hard time watching movies where someone’s possessed. To this day I haven’t watched The Exorcist in full, even though I’ve watched clips and it’s obviously not very scary. It’s a bit funny, honestly. But I still can’t do it.Who would you want to play you in the biopic of your life?I actually don’t know! Willem Dafoe! No, I’m just kidding. Get to it, A24.What is the weirdest thing you have done for love?I look back and feel like I’ve always tolerated more than I should have. That’s pretty weird when you think about. I don’t want to put them on blast but sometimes you’re in relationships with people that you’re not in love with by any means and it’s like, why did I do that? I find that strange.I do feel like there are times where people tell you things afterwards; where you find out things that everyone knew except you, but no one told you until after you broke up. It’s like, why are you even telling me this now? Gee, thanks for looking out for me, I guess!"}

Meanwhile feature films are being made about Dmitri Shostakovich, George Frideric Han­del, Richard Wagner and Joseph Bologne. Boléro, a film about French composer Maurice Ravel, had its premiere at the International Film Festival Rotterdam earlier this year.The projects follow the Oscar-nominated Maestro, released 18 months ago, in which Bradley Cooper portrayed Leonard Bernstein, the composer and conductor.Christopher Hampton, who won Oscars for Dangerous Liaisons and The Father, has written the screenplay for a new feature film about Shostakovich. Asked why so many film-makers are now looking at the lives of classical composers, he said: “Maybe the film Maestro fed into this a bit. Maybe it made people think you can make such films.“Financiers are naturally suspicious about anything to do with art. But composers often do lead very interesting lives. It’s not like writing about writers, which is really difficult, as you watch them with a pen and a bit of paper.”Dmitri Shostakovich composing, c. 1940s. Photograph: Library of Congress/Getty ImagesHampton has written the screenplay for The Noise of Time, based on Julian Barnes’s novel, a fictionalised retelling of Shostakovich’s life under Stalin that was described by the Observer as a “masterpiece”. Its story brings out the torment experienced by Shostakovich who, like all Soviet composers, was required to compose music that embraced the ideals of patriotism for ‘Mother Russia’. With the state watching his every move, he fell foul of the regime.He said: “The unique thing about him was that he … chose to stay, rather than becoming an émigré like all the rest of them. So the story is about an artist trying to work out ways to maintain his integrity while doing what he was told.”Hampton, who is rehearsing his latest play, Visit From An Unknown Woman, an adaptation of a Stefan Zweig short story, which will have its English-language premiere at the Hampstead Theatre in north London later this month added: “[Shostakovich] was the adored wunderkind of Russia but, after the act II interval of his opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk – which had been a huge success – he looked up at the box and Stalin and the politburo had not come back. Three days later, he was denounced in Pravda.Anthony Hopkins will play Handel, ‘a genius breaking all the rules’. Photograph: The Observer“The rest of his life was a misery … They wouldn’t even give him enough paper. Composers used to have to be issued composition paper from the composers’ union. He turned up one year and they gave him a tenth of what [he] was used to.”The film, directed by Jan Komasa, will reflect that, despite tragedy and oppression, Shostakovich could never suppress his humour, Hampton said. “He used to make a toast every New Year’s Eve saying: let’s drink in the hope that things will not get better.” August Diehl, whose acclaimed films include Terrence Malick’s wartime drama A Hidden Life, has been cast as the composer. Andrea Riseborough, who received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of an alcoholic single mother in To Leslie, will play his wife, Nita.A film about Handel, entitled The King of Covent Garden, will star Oscar-winner Sir Anthony Hopkins as the German-born son of a surgeon who became a British citizen in 1727, and is scheduled for release late next year.Its story is set during the period that he worked on his choral master­piece Messiah. The film-makers describe it as “a powerfully majestic celebration of genius breaking all the rules”.The Ravel film, Boléro, has been sold to 20 countries, while a UK distributor is yet to be found. Warner Classics has released an album of its soundtrack. It is directed and co-written by Anne Fontaine, with Raphaël Personnaz portraying Ravel and cele­brated French pianist Alexandre Tharaud playing “Ravel’s hands” and the piano parts heard in the film.Raphaël Personnaz as Ravel in Boléro. Photograph: Ciné@/Cinéfrance StudiosFontaine wanted to discover Ravel through his “bewitching” 1928 composition Boléro. The composer himself once said: “I have composed only one masterpiece, and that is Boléro; unfortunately, it is devoid of music.”Fontaine said: “How can we not feel empathy with this character who dislikes his own creation?”While Sky is adapting Peter Shaf­fer’s award-winning stage play Ama­deus into a series starring Will Sharpe as Mozart and Paul Bettany as his fierce rival Salieri, US film-maker Solomon J LeFlore is developing a major movie about their contemporary, Joseph Bologne, who was born into slavery and went on to become a violin virtuoso and composer.The son of a plantation owner and a teenage Senegalese enslaved woman, Bologne became a composer in Marie Antoinette’s court, wrote symphonies, concertos and string quartets – many lost during the French Revolution – and was described by the former US president John Adams as “the most accomplished man in Europe”. The film, Le Chevalier: Beauty and Betrayal, portrays him as a “transformational renaissance man and abolitionist, whose story is of such importance today, but whose name has long been neglected in western classical music tradition”, LeFlore said.In the forthcoming Wagner in Ven­ice, writer-director Daniel Graham fictionalises the composer’s final months in his beloved Venice with his wife, Cosima, and her father, Franz Liszt.Graham said: “It’s certainly true that we’re in the middle of a period of great interest in biopics of artists and musicians. Their lives defy the norm, exceed the possible, and therefore appeal to an audience wanting to celebrate this.”"}

Within a few months, there will be 162; within a decade, with another gigantic project proposed next door, about 350.And that’s just to the north. In every other direction, Finlay says with a sweep of his hand, wind developers are knocking on farmers’ doors.“People either like wind turbines or they don’t like them. It’s quite polarising,” says Finlay, once president of the National Farmers’ Federation and now chair of the government’s centrepiece drought policy, the Future Drought Fund. He says the view “doesn’t really worry me”.‘Income diversification is critical for long-term survival in Australian agriculture,’ says Brent Finlay, who chairs the Future Drought Fund. Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianAt least 30 turbines are located on Finlay’s land. For him and the nine other landowners hosting the MacIntyre windfarm, it is a financial lifeline.The project is the largest onshore windfarm in the southern hemisphere and covers about 36,000 hectares of rocky grazing country south of the rural town of Karara, about 200km south-west of Brisbane. Five years ago it suffered its worst drought in living memory.“Income diversification is critical for long-term survival in Australian agriculture,” Finlay says. “What we hear in the predictions are larger droughts, longer droughts, deeper droughts into the future.”Governments may have their sights on renewable energy – critical for reducing reliance on fossil fuels in order to curb the worst of global heating – but for farmers, it’s more about surviving it at all.The deal struck by the group of landowners and the windfarm’s developer, Spanish renewable energy giant Acciona, is confidential, but lobby group Farmers for Climate Action has said annual payments to farmers average $40,000 a turbine.That estimate would put total compensation, shared between the 10 landowners, at $162m over the project’s 25-year lease agreement. It is a potentially significant additional income alongside earnings from their wool and meat operations that can coexist with turbines humming overhead.Finlay calls himself a “renewable energy farmer”, but not everyone is convinced.What about the neighbours?“Everyone over there has got turbines and I don’t begrudge that,” says grazier Scott Tait.Tait runs cattle on a property at Karara but lives outside the area. “If we were offered the opportunity to host turbines I suppose we’d take it too,” he says.From a hill on his property, which Tait says he planned to build a house on, the blades of half a dozen MacIntyre turbines poke above a distant stand of eucalypts. Tait says Acciona representatives assured him the turbines wouldn’t be visible from his house site.‘There needs to be a better system of taking into account the impact on small rural communities,’ says Scott Tait, a neighbour of the MacIntyre windfarm. Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianThe new development on Acciona’s books, Herries Range, will see turbines built in the other direction. The rapidly expanding landscape of steel towers and fibreglass blades that stretch 285m into the sky has left Tait saying he feels powerless. And unlike his neighbours who host turbines, he had not received any compensation.It is this group of people – neighbours, not hosts – who are showing a growing resentment toward the renewable energy boom. French energy company Engie this week announced a plan to offer a $1,000 rebate on energy bills to those who live near its solar and wind developments in an effort to build support.“If this is the way we have to go, if this is the future, there needs to be a better system of taking into account the impact on small rural communities,” Tait says.MacIntyre windfarm, the largest windfarm under construction in Australia. Photograph: David Kelly/The Guardian Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianIn a statement, an Acciona spokesperson said Tait’s land is more than 5km from the nearest turbine and the company will continue to engage with him about his concerns while “discussing potential impact and mitigation”.Mitigating the impact on rural communities is a concern in renewable energy developments across the country, says former national energy infrastructure commissioner Andrew Dyer. Neighbour agreements – compensation for landowners who don’t host turbines themselves but are close to properties that do – can allay concerns.“It means neighbours can then be part of the winning team rather than the losing team,” Dyer tells Guardian Australia.Windfarm development is attracting complaints from locals dissatisfied with what they perceive as a lack of consultation. Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianA review authored by Dyer found Australia’s renewable energy rollout had created a “material distrust” of energy developers due to a lack of community engagement. The government has committed $20.7m to implementing its recommendations.Should Australia go nuclear? Why Peter Dutton's plan could be an atomic failure – video“It’s the fear of the unknown that often drives tension and concern, that’s fair enough, we’d all be concerned,” Dyer says. Decreases in the land value of neighbouring properties is another major concern, but there is “limited to no evidence” this eventuates, he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It depends on your values … we want it to thrive.”A new battlegroundTwo weeks ago, about 50 people gathered into a community centre in Greymare, Queensland in opposition to a prospective windfarm in the area. Among the crowd were state Liberal MP James Lister, who took their concerns to parliament.‘We have not been able to have a say, we have not been able to have an opinion,’ says Lindy Bennett (left), who with Rose Uwins organised a meeting in Greymare opposing windfarm development. Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianUnlike the vast land holdings that host the MacIntyre windfarm, Greymare is dotted with retirees and tree-changers on small hobby farms.The meeting was organised by Rose Uwins and Lindy Bennett, who moved to the area from Melbourne. “We have not had one iota of consultation, we have not been able to have a say, we have not been able to have an opinion,” Bennett says.It’s not the only community with concerns: last week the South Burnett regional council unanimously called for a moratorium on renewable energy projects until strict conditions are met.Opposition to renewable developments ranges from the lack of consultation and the visual impact to the localised environmental impacts, increases in traffic and increased pressure on an already stretched rental market.MacIntyre’s construction workforce peaked at about 750 last year. The majority lived in an on-site workers’ camp, but some lived in the nearby town of Warwick in the Southern Downs regional council. The mayor, Melissa Hamilton, says it has had an impact on housing availability.The MacIntyre windfarm project has to date added $678m to Queensland businesses, according to its developer. Photograph: David Kelly/The Guardian“A lot of families who could afford rent before have found themselves homeless,” she says.Wind developers are required to pay rates to local councils of roughly $10,000 per turbine. According to Acciona, the MacIntyre project has so far poured $678m into Queensland businesses, will employ up to 40 people and distribute $250,000 in community grants annually once operational and is supported by 58% of locals. The company said they could “learn from” the housing issue.At Greymare, some locals who have watched the MacIntyre development are arguing in support of the economic benefit of hosting a windfarm in their community, too.David Lawler, one of 25 farmers in early talks with a renewable energy developer.

It’s a theme – AI, that is, not the pigeons – that has been thoroughly mined in cinema of late, perhaps not surprisingly. After all, AI poses one of the more significant threats to the future of humankind. It’s the dystopian sci-fi premise that – literally – writes itself, given half the chance. But the eponymous beast in this story is not AI, and Bonello’s approach to the subject is rather more eccentric and original. It’s certainly the most ambitious of his films, which include the fashion biopic Saint Laurent and The House of Tolerance, about a turn-of-the-century Parisian brothel.Elliptical, enigmatic and infused with a luxuriant melancholy, The Beast won’t be for everyone, but submit to its looping structure and beguiling dream logic, and this extremely loose adaptation of a novella by Henry James weaves a bewitching, if a trifle head-swimming spell. (It’s worth mentioning that the same novella, The Beast in the Jungle, was adapted into another film last year, a version that plays out entirely in a nightclub over several decades, directed by Patric Chiha and starring Anaïs Demoustier and Tom Mercier.)Here, a sphinxlike and inscrutable Léa Seydoux is central to The Beast’s uneasy fascination. She plays the shape-shifting Gabrielle Monnier in three different time periods: a celebrated pianist and society beauty in Paris, 1910; an aspiring model and actor in Los Angeles in 2014. And in 2044, she’s a woman living in an AI-controlled society in which to be fully human is to be a lower-status entity in a world that aspires to be dispassionate, emotionless and as close as possible to the machine ideal.If there is a monster lurking in the shadows of these three linked stories, it’s shapeless, paralysing fearThe Gabrielle of 2044 is an intelligent woman forced to do the most stultifying of drudge work. To get a more challenging and rewarding role, she must submit to a kind of psychic purification process intended to divest her of not just her emotional baggage, but her emotions entirely. This is a world that has been pulled back from the brink of catastrophe, we learn, by ensuring that no decisions are made by people experiencing anger or fear. This seems reasonable enough until you learn that to effect this rule, nobody can feel anything at all.The production and costume design departments work in tandem to create an oppressively tasteful coldness in the look of this section of the picture. Characters dress in emotion-dampening shades of muted beige and taupe; the architecture is all clean lines and no clutter, as though all the personality and individuality has been stripped from the world. Immersed in a bath of what looks like oil – an image that evokes Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin (another film that pushes the sci-fi genre into uncharted territory) – Gabrielle submits to a robotic probe in her ear and a tour of the trauma accumulated during her past lives.Certain themes and elements become apparent. There’s the pigeon, for a start: a signifier, according to a fortune-teller, of an imminent death in the household. Dolls are another motif, from the flammable celluloid figures of 1910, created in a factory owned by Gabrielle’s husband, to Kelly (Saint Omer star Guslagie Malanda), a slightly sinister android doll companion for Gabrielle in 2044. But the main recurring element is a man named Louis Lewanski, played by George MacKay, acting in French and English with British and American accents.Partying like it’s 2044… MacKay and Seydoux in The Beast. Photograph: Carole BethuelIn 1910, in an extravagantly ornamental vision of Paris shot on sumptuous 35mm, Gabrielle and Louis are on the brink of a grand affair. But, plagued by premonitions of disaster, Gabrielle can’t quite bring herself to commit. Meanwhile, a great flood threatens to engulf the city and its thwarted lovers.The film’s vision of 2014 is glitchy, terminally online and achingly isolated. Gabrielle, housesitting a luxury modernist pad and failing to get work, spends her time staring, glazed, at her computer screen or dancing alone at a club. Louis is an “incel”, stewing in his sense of injustice and trawling the streets at night looking for fuel for his grievances against women. Once again, their encounter seems doomed to end in tragedy. In 2044, Louis is undergoing the same pre-purification interview process as Gabrielle, and he shows up in a nostalgic nightclub that dedicates itself to the music and fashion of a different era every night – they meet in 1972, and then again in 1963.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe heady and elusive storytelling of The Beast means that its true nature remains as mercurial as the shifting identities of its central characters. But if there is a monster lurking in the shadows of these three linked stories, it’s the shapeless, paralysing fear that prevents each version of Gabrielle and Louis from accepting and living their truth."}

So say, if you are overweight, you can say jokes. But if you’re not (you can’t) that’s kind of what’s currently happening. So it’s not really gendered.”Reflecting on whether this is a good or bad thing, she said: “I think that’s hard. It’s going into this territory of like saying, ‘Well, only straight actors can play straight roles, and gay actors can play gay roles,’ which I think is total nonsense.“I think you should be able to play any role that you want. But I always think, in comedy, your job is to always flirt with that line of what’s acceptable. Sometimes you do step over it but, at the end of the day, you are trying to entertain people.”She added: “If people are just always being safe and protective, you’re not going to get good comedy from that.”Bridesmaids actor Wilson also discussed her relationship with fiancee Ramona Agruma, who she proposed to in Disneyland last year.On coming out to their respective families, Wilson said: “I’m lucky in my case, even though I come from a very conservative background, it went very, very well ... My grandparents, who are in their 90s, just so chilled and cool with it.“Ramona’s family, not as much. Her mum has luckily come around now, her father still doesn’t talk to her, but we’re hoping that will change.”Wilson said she had been in the process of using a surrogate to have a child when she met Agruma – having to tell her just three months into their relationship.“I’d already been planning to use a surrogate to have a child and I’d done several rounds of IVF and I had one embryo transfer, which sadly didn’t work,” Wilson said.“Almost right at meeting Ramona, I was planning on the second embryo transfer and I was like, ‘Babe I don’t know how to tell you this, but I’m going to have a child kind of around November.’”She added: “Ramona just looked at me and said, ‘Well, I love you and if you have a child, I’m going to love your child exactly the same way.’”The TV presenter and actor added that she hoped her daughter Royce, born in November 2022, had her work ethic and always feels loved.The full interview with Wilson will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 10am and will also be available on BBC Sounds."}

The offspring could then be crossed back into the original breed.“The reality is it doesn’t take many crossbreeds before you get back to a dog which looks like the original,” Rusbridge said.She is adamant the approach does not mean doing away with beloved dog breeds, or creating designer pooches. Instead, the idea is to save them. “Reboot the breed,” she said.Crucially, Rusbridge added, such efforts must involve the formation of crossbreed registries, and a route by which later generations can be registered as pedigree members of the original breed.The approach has already been adopted in several Nordic countries, with Finland launching separate outcrossing projects for the cavalier King Charles spaniel and the French bulldog.“Altogether, there have been or are ongoing at the moment over 10 official cross breeding projects in Finland,” said Kaisa Gold, secretary of the scientific committee of the Finnish Kennel Club.Lena Gillstedt, a breeder involved in an outcrossing project run by the Swedish Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club, said: “Of course, there are some breeders who are sceptical and even negative. But overall, the consensus among breeders has been very high.”She added that so far six litters had been born and more were on the way.But not everyone is convinced.Michael Levy, chair of the UK-based Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club, said although the organisation watched such efforts with interest, they “currently do not see this as a solution to some of the health issues we face with our popular breed”.He added: “As with any breeding, selection is of the utmost importance and health is the priority always in those selections. Health testing is conducted and encouraged by all the breed clubs.”He said his club strongly advocated that breeders DNA test their dogs for MMVD, while a new scheme would start soon to reduce the prevalence of syringomyelia.The UK Kennel Club said it had accepted outcrossing projects, similar to those in Finland, for various breeds over the years – although none have included French bulldogs or cavalier King Charles spaniels – and had a pathway back to pedigree status.But Dr Joanna Ilska, genetics research manager at the Kennel Club, said there must be robust evidence and a plan in place to maximise the chances of outcrossing improving health and ensure improvements were successfully spread through the breed.“We continue to urge breeders to participate in health screening their dogs prior to deciding to breed and the Kennel Club has developed a number of tools to not only help breeders make responsible decisions, but also to collect data, which is vital for future actions and solutions to protect dog health,” she said.Rusbridge said a more proactive approach was needed, noting that at present it is up to breed clubs to push for outcrossing projects with the Kennel Club. “Attitudes across the board need to change,” she said."}

This is why I Kissed a Girl is unmissable viewing | Florence Scordoulis | The Guardian", "caption": "The BBC has come up with a celebratory, joyful love letter to queerness, says journalist Florence Scordoulis", "author": "Florence Scordoulis", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/02/i-kissed-a-girl-unmissable-viewing-sisterhood-sexual-edge", "text": "I’ve always seemed to miss the point with reality TV. Watching Love Island felt like wasting my life. I never understood why people were hooked on something so well-known for its toxic impact on mental health, for viewers and contestants. But, since watching BBC Three’s wholesome new queer dating show I Kissed a Girl, I finally see what all the fuss is about. I’ve binged every episode, and now that it’s ending tonight I’m heartbroken.If you haven’t seen I Kissed a Girl, the show begins with 10 single women entering the masseria – a fancy, villa-esque Italian farmhouse. Striding across poolside, they must greet their matches with a club-style snog. And it only gets gayer. Activities and challenges (think: lots of chat about feelings) are designed to test their compatibility. Extra girls are thrown in to spice things up. Every few days, couples decide whether to recommit in the brutal kiss-off: a back-to-back countdown, where they either turn to kiss their partner, or don’t and save it for someone else. Anyone left unkissed is off the show.As the show’s host, Dannii Minogue, reminds us: “There’s no room for fake love in the masseria.” This makes sense, because, in fighting to live authentically, LGBTQ+ people have less room for bullshit. This means the hunt for true romance feels more genuine, with various couples voluntarily splitting for surprisingly healthy reasons, like lack of emotional availability, even if it means leaving the show alone.The contestants also spend a lot of time lounging around the pool in bikinis, straddling each other on sunbeds, gossiping about which “girlies” they fancy. Yet, although there’s gay drama in abundance, it’s rooted in care and respect. The girl code is strong, which means any put-downs get called out, especially if they’re made behind someone’s back. And even the inevitable reality TV pot-stirring usually seems to come from the well of fierce friendship and loyalty, rather than toxic attention-seeking, as in similar shows.Indeed, this is much more than a dating competition: really, it’s a microcosm of queer women’s culture, friendships and community, which are as important to our sexualities as our love lives. It is everything I wish I’d seen growing up in the noughties, when our representation was sparse and overwhelmingly negative. I can only recall seeing women kissing once on TV, in that infamous scene between Sky and Lana in Neighbours. Plus, bisexuality was rarely portrayed as an option. Take Carrie Bradshaw’s damning line in Sex and the City: “I’m not even sure bisexuality exists. I think it’s just a layover on the way to Gaytown.”In contrast, I Kissed a Girl gets the nuances right. One contestant, Georgia, cries while talking about how “lesbian” has been a dirty word with negative societal connotations. In another scene, Cara, Meg and Lailah, who are all bisexual, discuss the impact of biphobia, including stereotypes around greediness and cheating, and how it comes from both straight and gay people. That resonated with me.The cast seem to have been chosen to represent the rainbow: from lipstick lesbians to butch football types and “edgy femme” bisexuals. Collect ’em all! They discuss classic queer tropes, such as “u-hauling” (women moving super-fast in relationships), as well as other challenges, including coming-out traumas and struggling to accept themselves. It’s done with a celebratory, joyful tone that is a love letter to their queerness.Yet don’t be fooled. You get to see women as players too – and this is also what is so radical about I Kissed a Girl. It shows women lusting after women, without it being for the male gaze. They dress up for “thirst trap” parties, compliment each other’s boobs and delight in objectifying Minogue – who plays up to it with a succession of extravagant outfits.This is sisterhood with a sexual edge. (Straight men take note: there’s a lot to learn from our uplifting brand of objectification.) Above all, what makes I Kissed a Girl so revolutionary is the way it rebrands queerness as something aspirational: in watching a bunch of hot women obsess about each other, living and loving their sparkliest lives in gay paradise, it looks like a VIP club you’re dying to join.I’m positive that this will make a difference for the baby gays growing up today. But I hope that their families watch it too, because it could go a long way towards destigmatising and myth-busting some of the fears that sadly still exist. Indeed, it just goes to show: when done right, reality TV can be a powerful force for good – because nothing beats seeing yourself reflected in the lives of real people. So, yes, I’m a proud convert. And if I’m still single next year? Sign me up."}

When that gambit failed, Origin set an August 2025 closing date – seven years earlier than scheduled prior to the extension, dimming prospects for Eraring’s 230-odd employees.Despite the uncertainty, King, who is a delegate with the Mining and Energy Union, says he knows of only one person who left the plant for another job. He cites a survey predicting workers leaving the sector would cop a 60% to 70% pay cut: “To face that is quite confronting.”Eraring, which supplies one-fifth of NSW’s electricity, is now obliged to generate half that share – or 6 terawatt-hours a year – until August 2027. It may then run for another 20 months but without state support.The period of limbo will linger for many in the Lake Macquarie region, including green groups who fear the legacy of Eraring’s 35m tonne coal ash dam, and authorities and firms working to prime the economy for a post-coal future in one of Australia’s fastest growing population centres 120km from Sydney.‘On the scrap heap’Intervention by the Minns Labor government may have granted Eraring a temporary reprieve but so far there is no reprieve for 1,000 workers at the two nearby coalmines.Origin is negotiating with Centennial Coal over contracts expiring at the end of June. The Myuna mine has no other outlet for its coal, while Mandalong exports half its output and can’t lift shipments through Newcastle if the Eraring deal falls through.Peter Land’s dad started work at Mandalong when it opened, and his 20-year-old son Hayden is now a first-year apprentice training for Myuna, making it potentially three generations supplying Eraring.Eraring, which supplies one-fifth of NSW’s electricity, is now obliged to generate half that share – or 6 terawatt-hours a year – until August 2027. Photograph: Brydie Piaf/The Guardian“They’ll essentially be thrown out on the scrap heap” even before their first year of training ends, Land says of his son and two other apprentices gathered at Myuna this week.Miners had hoped the government would demand Eraring’s traditional mines also benefited from the extension. Instead, Mach Energy’s Mt Pleasant and New Hope’s Bengalla mines in the Hunter Valley look set to fill the void.Myuna’s staff and many at Mandalong now “have got no idea where they will go in four weeks’ time”, Land says. Car loans and mortgages too will be in jeopardy.Origin posted a 17-fold increase in profit and secured a deal for the state to absorb 80% of any Eraring losses – as much as $450m – for two years. It now wants to squeeze miners, says Belinda Giblin, lead organiser of the Collieries’ Staff & Officials Association.“Do they have to have a social conscience and accept that there is a cost to doing business and [do] the right thing?” Giblin says.An Origin spokesperson says negotiations with Centennial are “ongoing and we are hopeful of reaching an outcome. It would be wrong to imply a commercial outcome can’t be reached.”Guardian Australia understands rival mines are offering prices Centennial will struggle to match. Government data estimated Myuna’s coal price as about $175/tonne and Mandalong’s $297/t, and officials say they won’t interfere with Eraring’s commercial decisions.Other interventions – or their absence – will be closely watched by environmentalists.Belinda Giblin: ‘Do they have to have a social conscience and accept that there is a cost to doing business and [do] the right thing?’ Photograph: Brydie Piaf/The Guardian‘Health and environmental risk’Abigail Boyd, the Greens MP who initiated a 2019 upper house inquiry into remediation of coal ash dams including Eraring’s, says the government has a “conflict of interest within themselves”.Tighter regulation of pollution entering the environment via smoke stacks or the ash dump will increase plant costs. The risk-sharing arrangement means taxpayers could be on the hook for much of any additional losses.“These privatisation deals that were done by the previous [Coalition] government sentenced the people of the Central Coast to additional decades of health and environmental risk,” Boyd adds.Had governments acted on the inquiry’s recommendations in March 2021, the health picture might have been clearer, says Gary Blashchke from Future Sooner, a local group.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Separately, two children at the same preschool recently developed brain cancer and two teenagers died with spinal tumours.“It sort of got me thinking, what the hell’s going on?” he says.Gary Blaschke from Future Sooner: ‘What the hell’s going on?’ Photograph: Brydie Piaf/The GuardianIn 2017, the government examined the safety of eating fish and crustacea caught in Lake Macquarie, a common activity, particularly near the outlet canals for cooling water from Eraring and the Vales Point coal-fired power station.The EPA recommends limiting crab consumption because of elevated levels of cadmium, a toxic metal. Selenium, lead and mercury are other contaminants.An EPA spokesperson says the agency is “working on a comprehensive and independent assessment of environmental impacts of coal ash dams”. It expects to release its finding by mid-2024, including monitoring of the lake’s water quality.Health minister Ryan Park said NSW Health was “working closely with partner agencies to assess the impact of this on the health of communities, and I look forward to reviewing their findings in due course”.NSW Health commissioned a review of environmental data to determine whether people living close to power stations and coal ash dams “were exposed to potentially hazardous chemicals through air, water, soil or local fish and seafood”.“The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water has prepared a draft report on possible pathways and likelihood of exposure to coal ash and other pollutants of concern,” the spokesperson said, adding the report would be subject to further community consultation when completed in coming months.Coal ash needn’t remain in the landscape forever. It can be reused as an ingredient for concrete and road foundations, an economic activity encouraged by David Antcliff, director of development at the Lake Macquarie city council.Planning restrictions often curb councils’ ability to grow but Antcliff says his region has “enough zoned land for housing for the next 20 years”. Rather, the council is desperate to access land for industry – such as for offshore windfarm developers – to generate jobs once the mines and power stations close.“Mining lands is actually the big story here,” he says. These occupy thousands of hectares that “for decades and decades had provided a huge amount of economic prosperity … but that’s very much coming to an end and very soon”.Complicated rules have slowed their repurposing, in some cases by two decades.“It’s illogical for me to be approving development applications on virgin bushland and knocking it down when I’ve got disturbed industrial land next door that’s literally having trees grown on it,” Antcliff said.The region’s “test case” is the Black Rock Motor Resort atop a former Rhondda underground colliery dormant since 1970, being developed by Tony Palmer.The $95m race track, Australia’s second-longest at 5.25km, will have luxury accommodation, a function centre and provide more than 220 jobs when it opens in June 2026. Electric vehicles and innovative fuels will feature in the project.“With all of the incentives that are thrown in the directions of the miners, there’s zero coming back over the fence to the developers that have a vision,” Palmer says. Attempts at seeking support are “just not worth the paper it’s written on and a waste of air”."}

I spent my teenage years and early 20s trying to navigate dating and relationships while missing a key piece of information about myself – that I was an autistic ADHDer. I didn’t know that I was prone to feeling things much more deeply than most people, or that masking made me a chronic people pleaser. I didn’t know that I had a social disability, or that my dopamine-seeking brain might look for stimulation from problematic places (or people). I thought that my too much-ness was just a result of being unlovable, broken or a “bad dater”.It can be helpful to go armed with three conversation topics so you can avoid small talk (if you want to)I often speak about my late diagnosis as a “lightbulb moment” – up until that point, I’d spent my entire life stumbling around in a dark room, walking into walls and knocking things over. Then one day someone turned on the light and allowed me to see what had been going on. Don’t get me wrong – that doesn’t mean that the room was tidy or straightforward to deal with once the light was on. There was a huge pile of mess that I’d never known was there that needed to be worked through, but at least I could start the process.This analogy stands strong with dating and relationships in particular – by no means has my love life become infinitely easier or more straightforward since my diagnosis, but I am at least aware of the challenges I might face, the tendencies I have, and the type of qualities I might want to look for in a person.I sadly cannot give you a handbook on how to have an excellent love life as an autistic person or an ADHDer, but I can share a few pointers which have been helpful for me.Mini golf can make for a great first date. Photograph: Matt Alexander | PA Media.1. Get activeDon’t worry – I am not about to recommend that you head to an aerobics class for your first date. However, I think “activity dates” (such as bowling, mini golf, or even a walk in the park) are a great place to start. You don’t have to worry about whether you’re making enough eye contact with your date (you’re either side by side while walking or looking in the direction of the activity you’re doing), and you will always have something to talk about, rather than be left scrambling to make small talk about the weather.As an autistic person, I spend my whole life scripting out imaginary conversations to prepare for every possible scenario – this can actually be helpful when it comes to avoiding awkward silences on dates. You might find it helpful to go armed with three conversation topics so you can avoid small talk (if you want to) and always have something that you feel comfortable speaking about to fall back on. This is also helpful to bear in mind when writing prompts on dating apps – answer them in a way that will make people more likely to message you about something you would like to talk about.3. Communicate your needsYou might feel nervous about communicating what you need from somebody, but it’s likely that, if someone hasn’t dated an autistic/ADHD person before, they simply don’t know what it is that you need – whether that be clearer communication, more space for decompression, or to avoid noisy or busy places. Don’t be afraid to ask for it.4. Do YOU like them?As someone who has possibly faced social difficulties, it is likely that your first thought when dating someone is, “do they like me?”. Rejection sensitivity dysphoria makes us want to avoid rejection at all costs – even if we don’t like them in the first place. After a first date, check in and ask yourself to list five things you liked about them.5. Deepen your dating poolA big part of masking is mimicking the people around us; for me, this even meant that if all my friends thought someone was hot, I must be attracted to them too. Don’t be afraid to try dating different people than who you’ve traditionally dated, whether that’s looks-wise or even exploring your sexuality. As you unmask and discover the real you, it is likely what you’re looking for in a partner might change too."}

The shame that is creeping in may be about pressure to conform", "author": "Philippa Perry", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jun/02/i-dont-want-to-invite-my-alcoholic-dad-to-my-wedding", "text": "The question I’m a 30-year-old man who works in mental health. I’m due to get married in a few months’ time. I don’t want to invite my father. He and I have been estranged for several years. We have each other’s mobile numbers, but we don’t use them. My father has a lifelong alcohol-use disorder (AUD). He was a violent man. When I was 11, my mother managed to divorce him. Since then, we have mostly parted ways, but his side of the family still attempts to guilt-trip me into caring for him.I have grown up, gone to college and am now enjoying my career. I have come to understand more about addiction. I don’t feel resentment towards him and tend to see this in a matter-of-fact way. I do not have any affection for this man, who happens to be my father. I have come to see him as any other person with AUD, but one who happens to have fathered me for a short period of time. (I don’t have fond memories of the time we shared in the same household.)But as we get closer to the wedding day, I fear the absence of the father of the groom will be noticeable and commented upon, given that the bride will have both her parents there. I feel no love or attachment to him. My partner and her family say they’ll support me whatever decision I come to. Can you help me feel a bit more reassured, or less afraid about not inviting him?Philippa’s answer What is it about weddings that makes us believe we must follow so many protocols and rules? You wouldn’t hesitate not to ask your father to any other event. What is the cultural norm we are trying squeeze into here? Is shame involved? Rationally, you know that having an irresponsible, violent, drunk father is not your fault and yet I wonder if you have feelings that it’s somehow shameful not to invite him. Are you imagining people disapproving of you for not having him there? Not inviting him is the lesser of two evils, but it seems it is still something of an evil. I think in your shoes I might feel the same way, but why? You know what you want to do, but self-doubt is creeping in. I wondered whether to say to you that you must invite him. Because then you might be likely to rise up in opposition and be more determined to say no. But paradoxical interventions are risky and I really would not like for you to have your father at the wedding when you don’t want him there.When faced with the concept of a wedding, people have expectations. You are probably being bombarded with cultural norms and “shoulds” from friends, family and even Instagram, and I expect you are feeling some pressure to conform. You, like me, are a mental-health professional so you may know from experience that it can be easier to spot someone else’s issues than our own. A difficult childhood may mean that, as children, we had a little voice in our heads saying something along the lines of: “If only I was good, Dad would stop shouting.” Children tell themselves things like this and take responsibility for their treatment, because were they to believe themselves powerless (as they are) it would be too frightening. Too frightening to believe that someone out of control was in charge of them, or that they had zero power to make their dad love them and stop being drunk. Feeling responsible gives them the hope that if only they could get it right, the horribleness would stop.There may be a little kid in you still trying to ‘do the right thing’I’m imagining something like that may be in your subconscious mind and you are again confronted with the possibility of getting it right or getting it wrong for other people, or even him. Rationally you know it’s not your fault he has alcohol-use disorder, but I wonder if the little kid in you wants to do what he might think is the right thing. You say your father is just like any other addict to you, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s how you want to think of him rather than how you really feel about him deep down. There may be the ghost of the kid in you thinking, “If only I could get it right.”We want to be “good” and get things “right” for the friends and family we do care about, because we want to be accepted, we want to belong and we want to be loved. You may not be being pressured into inviting him, but you may have been pressured about the meal, the ceremony and the flowers – so this wedding may be becoming something that has to be “right”, and then who to invite becomes part of this rightness.Trust your instincts and stay true to yourself and do not invite him. Inviting unreformed alcoholics to weddings is often a terrible idea no matter how closely related to the bride or groom they are, and neither do you want anyone there to whom you feel (mostly) indifferent. Yes, people may comment on his absence; it’s no reflection on you if they do. It’s absolutely OK not to follow every cultural norm of the wedding ritual.For help with these issues, go to Adfam (adfam.org.uk); Al-Anon (al-anonuk.org.uk) or DrugFAM (drugfam.co.uk)Every week Philippa Perry addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

{"title": "The new midlife crisis is hot, female and covered in tattoos - where do I sign? | Emma Beddington | The Guardian", "caption": "Forget the sports car and affair with a personal trainer. My generation of women are reaching this life stage messily, sensually and full of rage, writes Emma Beddington", "author": "Emma Beddington", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/02/new-midlife-crisis-hot-female-covered-in-tattoos-where-do-i-sign", "text": "I’m not having a midlife crisis. Any actuary would tell you I’m well over halfway, plus the years 30-40 were one long, undignified, slightly premature MLC (I won’t apologise for abbreviating; time is short – see first point) that I refuse to revisit. But I’m interested in that moment when mortality ceases to be a vague, polite murmur and becomes a screaming alarm. My cohort is now traversing Dante’s dark wood, so I feel surrounded if not by midlife crises (I’m experiencing disappointingly few vicarious ones), then by culture exploring them.Of course, each generation rediscovers and makes a fuss about universal experiences, but it feels like the MLC is in the midst of a makeover. First, it’s female. The new MLC queen is Miranda July, whose new novel All Fours is reframing perimenopausal turmoil as urgent, sensual, even “hot”. July has managed to make midlife angst feel fresh, but positing All Fours as a singular overdue examination of the crystallising, life-upturning effect of the end of fertility is a bit unfair to many who came before. What about Bridget Christie’s brilliant menopause sitcom The Change, for a start? I also think you don’t need to explicitly articulate the physical and emotional reckonings of perimenopause to create art informed by it. Rachel Cusk has been dissecting aspects of female midlife turmoil since her divorce memoir Aftermath, surely; Fleishman Is In Trouble is, in large part, a female MLC novel, and Deborah Levy’s extraordinary Living trilogy became a lodestar for a generation of women navigating the shifting sands of middle age (I solemnly gave it to my sister for her 39th birthday, as if transmitting a sacred text).Regardless, the female midlife crisis is having a moment. The menopause/MLC intersection has been comprehensively memeified recently (at least according to my algorithm) and new online mag, Jenny, launched in January offering a buffet of compellingly messy midlife content (dating younger men, getting 10 tattoos, taking Ozempic and more). The sports car and affair with a personal trainer are out; creative flowering, new ways of living and sexual rumspringa are in. That’s welcome and yes, overdue. But there are other MLC 2024 elements that are generational and situational, not gendered.As New York magazine explored recently (perfectly illustrated with a piece of avocado toast sitting up in a coffin), millennials are hitting their 40s and their experience is very much not your mama’s midlife. Traditionally “a midlife crisis was born out of a complacent sense of security”; now, many midlifers haven’t been able to acquire the previous generation’s signifiers of stability: home, job security, pension, possibly kids. On the contrary, they face “a distinct lack of comfort, of resources”. A midlife crisis? In this economy?Then there are the existential challenges of life in 2024. Every day, I read at least one headline that scares me silly and I don’t need to enumerate them to any Guardian reader. Are we even going to get the lifespan we thought we could expect? When you’re living through paroxysm after paroxysm of a polycrisis, indulging in the midlife variety could feel a little surplus to requirements. Who on earth, in 2024, feels that the rest of their life is so comfortably, predictably mapped out that they’re compelled to kick against it?That suggests the MLC might be becoming irrelevant, but actually, I think it might be becoming more radical. A generation reaching midlife without the security it was promised is questioning, even wondering how to dismantle, the systems and structures that failed to deliver. I’m not hearing about old school midlife drama from friends, but I am hearing plenty from people sick of unfulfilling and unstable work, profound inequities and inaccessible housing, childcare and healthcare. They aren’t questioning their individual life choices so much as the way these have been curtailed and threatened, the paucity of political alternatives on offer and how all of that could – and must – change.Conventionally, midlife crises ended in a sheepish realisation of how much you could lose by setting fire to your life, a renewed appreciation for comfort, possibly a settling into caution and conservatism. At least in a world already on fire, there’s little chance of that happening. Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In March, kicking off what I hope will be a very long series of articles, I wrote that I was in “great shape” for a 60-year-old, with plans to make it to 100. I ran 30-40km every week, I added, on top of yoga and high-intensity interval training. In April I celebrated my “freakishly strong” core; in May my “remarkably youthful” brain. And that’s just what I put in writing. At home, I can barely pass a mirror without pulling up my shirt to admire the faint beginnings of a six-pack. When I’m running and I overtake someone decades younger, I get such a bounce in my step that even I think I deserve a slap.But here’s the thing: what’s mostly going through my mind is not: “I’m amazing!” but: “I’m amazed!” For three-quarters of my life there was nothing to suggest I might ever get into shape. I don’t come from a sporty family, and as for school (with its rugby, cricket, football, gymnastics, swimming, etc) I remember precisely one game that I played rather than endured: a hockey match at 14 or 15, when I was in goal and, for once, found myself blocking shot after shot instead of watching them whiz into the net. This was the only time any of my teammates looked at me with something other than sympathy or scorn.Other than that, it was afternoon after afternoon of standing around bored, or running around uncomfortably, or being yelled at by an angry adult who had once dreamed of becoming a professional athlete.Sitting my way to an early grave … Phil Daoust and his now wife, Hannah, in more decadent days. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianI’m not saying I was traumatised, but I definitely wasn’t inspired. Over the next three decades, vaguely aware I should do something to look after my body, I had brief flirtations with rowing, swimming, cycling and kayaking, but mostly I concentrated on eating, drinking and sitting my way into an early grave.By the late 2000s, as I wrote at the time: “Not only was I clinically obese; I was in denial. I had broken a neighbour’s bench just by sitting on it. My mother would nod at my stomach and ask when ‘it’ was due. One so-called friend shouted ‘Thar he blows!’ when I joined him on a beach. I told myself I just needed to lose a few pounds, and it was normal for my thighs to rub holes in my jeans.” My cholesterol was far too high, and when I was on edge or miserable, the only remedy I knew was to open another bottle. And there always was another bottle. I was living in France, so even good wine was cheap – and I had a cellar.I was 45 before I made a real effort to improve my diet, 50 before I started the NHS’s “Couch to 5k” plan and discovered that running could structure my attempt to reshape myself; and 57 before I finally gave up booze. There was a lot of slippage on the way, but in my – no, seriously? – seventh decade it feels as if I’ve settled into a healthy relationship with my own body. And I think I’ve learned a few things worth sharing with other late starters.‘To build muscle back as you age, you will have to lift weights.’ Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianJust because you loathed PE, you will not necessarily hate all physical activity.This time there won’t be some blowhard whistling at you, or a supposed friend who would rather die than have you on his team. Now, you can choose how hard you push yourself, how long you spend doing it, and whether or not you do it when it’s raining, when you’re on your period, or when you just woke up aching.That said, don’t count on any kind of transcendental experience.It took me years of running before I got anything like a high.But don’t write off the possibility either.Last week’s yoga class was coming to an end, we were lying with our eyes closed in “corpse” pose and the instructor began massaging my temples with essential oil. I felt like a cat does when you rub it behind the ears.Don’t underestimate the power (and pleasure) of walking.It will shift weight (if that’s what you’re after), condition you for something more strenuous and give you space to think or listen to your favourite music or podcast. Although most of the world seems to have forgotten this, it will also get you places – and more reliably than any other form of transport. Your feet will never go on strike, get stuck in a jam or be held at a station while an engineer arrives to reset the emergency alarm.Start with something you may enjoy, not something that friends or experts swear is good for you.Your starter exercise does not have to provide an all-body workout or stretch your mind as well as your muscles. Your priority should be to get moving, and become comfortable with your body so you can branch out when you need to. Which you will, because …Even if cardio is your thing, you can’t ignore resistance work.The older we get, the more muscle we lose, making it more likely that we will “have a fall” – and struggle to recover from it. To build it back, you will have to lift weights, learn how to use those frightening machines in the gym, or leverage the weight of your own body with push-ups, planks, lunges and squats.Even if resistance work is your thing, you can’t ignore cardio.For a long, active life you need to stretch your heart, lungs and circulation as well as your abs, glutes and traps.Phil takes a tipple, back in 2015.  Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThis world is nothing but hills!You’ll just have to suck this up once you start running, cycling or even walking seriously. Living at the bottom of a long, steep slope, I’m reconciled to starting most runs with a six-minute climb. There are lovely parks at the end of it, and a nature reserve, and more bloody hills.Sweating like a pig doesn’t mean you’re unfit.Sample size of one here, so it’s not exactly scientific, but I still get red and drippy as soon as my pulse is raised. If I’m exercising outdoors, I’m happiest in drizzle; if I’m doing hot yoga, with the room at 37C, there are puddles of brine around me. Sorry, yoga-mates. But also, if we’re 15 minutes in and you’re not even glowing, I hate you.If you’re not enjoying yourself, try to narrow down why.Is it the activity that’s rubbing you up the wrong way, or the environment? If you’re swimming, you may discover that you hate pools but love open water. If you’re running, you may far prefer roads, the treadmill or forest trails – with or without company, or music, or a target time and pace.When you exercise matters – just not in the way that most people say it does.Maybe you work out best at 6am on an empty stomach, a few hours later when you’ve had breakfast and given it time to settle, or even late at night. Whatever you choose, someone on the internet will tell you that you’re doing it all wrong for maximum gains, and have the scientific studies to prove it. Tell them to get stuffed. They’re talking about average or typical humans. You are you; you do you.You will rarely regret paying for an instructor or personal trainer. Gyms, however …If you find a trainer or teacher that you click with, and can afford a few classes, it will do wonders for your confidence and technique. When it comes to gyms, however, investing money in a membership is no guarantee you will invest time and effort. Do not sign a long-term contract unless you are 100% sure it is right for you.If you’re still working, your company may have arranged what looks like a fantastic 12-month deal with a local gym – but will you have time to use it in your lunch break, or the inclination to visit before or after work? Do you really want to be wiping your thigh-sweat off the hip adductor machine so your boss can use it after you? Come to think of it, do you even like being in a gym?You will move better if your hands are empty.skip past newsletter promotionPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifePrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You do you.’  Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianIf it’s hurting, stop it.A little soreness is usually fine, especially after you’ve exercised. If all you have to worry about is blisters, the squishy, expensive “healing” plasters are worth every penny. But don’t ignore anything stabbing, grinding, shooting or knee-buckling. Stop what you’re doing and take at least a week off. If you feel confident about resuming without seeing a doctor, physio (etc), start slowly and be prepared to stop again.In fact, if you’re hating it, stop it.Sometimes a workout just doesn’t work out – you’re more tired than you thought, or you can’t focus, or you are unexpectedly hating every minute. Give yourself a little longer; then, if you’re sure this isn’t something you can push through, cut the session short and tell yourself you’re making sure you’re in better shape for next time. Particularly at the start, you’re training your brain as much as your body. Try not to teach it that exercise is horrible.That said, the ‘second wind’ really is a thing.I often find myself struggling for the first 6km of a run, then finally hit my stride. I don’t pretend to understand why.Don’t expect exercise alone to fix your body.It’s part of the puzzle, but how you eat and feel and sleep are equally important. Also …If you’ve got a monkey on your back, maybe give it a little shake every now and again to see if it will let go.All the push-ups, pilates and ping-pong in the world won’t make up for a problem with drink, drugs or nicotine. I have no first-hand experience of the last two. All I know is that sometimes you can outlast what seemed like an integral part of life. In 2020, at least 40 years after my first ever alcoholic drink, I had what I hope and expect will be my last. It was the first time I’d managed to give up for more than a few weeks. By the time of that final glass, I was drinking at least a bottle of wine most nights. I have no idea how I stopped this time, or why I have since felt nothing more than mild longing for a mouthful of red when I am cooking. Maybe I was just ready? Maybe it was time? My drinking was never purely about stress, but it must have helped that exercise gave me another way to cope.If you’re fit enough to exercise with young people, go for it.Sure, you’re old enough to be everyone’s father. But no one is looking at you – not with that wrinkly skin. Or, if they are, it’s because they’re so impressed with your side plank. You, meanwhile, are being pushed a bit harder than you would with a bunch of over-55s.Embrace the cheerleaders, ignore the others.Someone, somewhere is aching to tell you that you’re wasting your time, or even heading for a heart attack. Try to remember you’re doing this for you, not for some idiot who never got over the fact that the man who popularised jogging died while – oh, my aching sides! – jogging. The last bloke who gave me some “friendly” advice was about my age and looked 20 years older. He was selling flowers outside a cemetery, which I guess was some kind of message.Phil, feeling smug. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianYou should probably try yoga.Leaving aside what it does for flexibility and balance, there’s something about it that chips away at your cynicism. I started out curling my lip at the “third eye” and the talk of gratitude; now I can bow my head and namaste with the best of them. If you’re a yogi looking for a slogan, could I suggest: “I can sweeten even the sourest old fart”?If you’re on a long run or cycle ride, make sure you know where the toilets are.Especially first thing in the morning – once you get your body moving, your bowels will also spring into action.Lifting a few dumbbells will not suddenly turn you into another Arnie.Even Schwarzenegger had to work incredibly hard at it. This is either very good news or very bad, depending on your #fitnessgoals.You’ll change your taste in music.One minute you’re listening to the Smiths and the KLF, the next it’s all Dua Lipa and Rihanna. Blame those exercise classes with their poppy earworms, and the fact that it’s more enjoyable to run to RiRi’s We Found Love than Morrissey singing Meat Is Murder.There may come a point where you no longer recognise yourself.My wife, who has also worked hard on her fitness, often jokes that the Phil and Hannah of 10 years ago would despise the Phil and Hannah of today. “What a couple of tossers,” she said the other night, as we headed off to a class together. But that says more about the old us than the new."}

But spirituality is not the same as being happy. Spirituality, according to almost of the world’s great wisdom traditions, requires work, service and sacrifice.The world’s dominant religions – Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam – all encourage practices such as yoga, mindfulness meditation, chanting, prayer, group singing and dancing. These have long been effective tools in giving followers an experience of deep connection, sometimes accompanied by sensations of awe, ecstasy and transcendence – feelings that encourage them to return.But a sense of joy or connectedness is not an end in itself. These feelings are the emotional motivators of ethical action. Every religion sets out rules for right conduct – consider Buddhism’s eight-fold path, Judaism’s 10 commandments, or Vedic Hinduism’s restraints and observances. Indigenous traditions go beyond these religions, including humans and non-humans (or “more-than-humans”, as the Potawatomi botanist and writer Robin Wall Kimmerer describes our partners in the natural world) in the circle of those to whom we owe service.Yet today’s global wellness industry would have us think that spirituality is just another dimension of feeling good. The Buddhist practitioner Miles Neale coined the term “McMindfulness” to describe the western tendency to extract practices from ancient religious traditions and turn them into “colourfully packaged bite-size morsels for … mass consumption”. The US$1.5tn wellness market seeks to sell the health benefits of spirituality, divorced from the ethical frameworks within which these practices developed.Religious ethical frameworks are hugely damaging when they are used to support power inequities in the realms of gender, class, race and sexual identity. But the use of spiritual practices, in the absence of any ethical requirements, can also be damaging. For example, scientific studies have shown that yoga and meditation can actually increase people’s sense of “spiritual superiority” and focus on the self rather than quieting the ego and encouraging charitable acts of service.Evangelical Christian megachurches have grown, well, “mega” through their use of age-old practices such as group singing, music and pageantry. They create experiences of “collective effervescence”, as identified by the sociologist Emile Durkheim back in 1912 as the foundation of religion. An age-old problem arises when churches connect such spiritual emotions not to ethical action but to intolerance, selfishness or greed.As far back as the 14th century, Christianity was taking advantage of people’s spiritual feelings for money-making ends, selling “indulgences” for the benefit of souls in purgatory (God’s hypothetical waiting room). Martin Luther opposed this practice as detracting from people’s ability to give to the poor. In one of religious history’s great ironies, Luther’s theology of a personal connection to God would eventually provide the foundation for the prosperity gospel of some of today’s megachurches.Living a spiritual life is not about adhering rigidly to a church dogma. Nor is it about engaging in practices such as meditation in the absence of a larger context. Indeed, yoga means “yoke” and the type of yoga popular in the west is just one way unite oneself with a greater consciousness, something bigger than oneself.

If I am going to spend 20 minutes a day sitting on my butt cultivating compassion to others, I am also going to get up and act on that sensation, making donations, volunteering or just being nice to someone I don’t really like. If I am going to sing about how God/dess loves us all every Sunday, I am also going to take that love and turn it into charitable, non-judgmental acts of kindness every other day of the week.I can meditate and do yoga (actually I kind of suck at yoga) or raise my hands in group worship. But I cannot treat these activities and the feelings they create as ends in themselves. These practices are tools to help me stay focused, cultivating the attitudes and emotions that sustain me as I attempt to live an ethical life.

{"title": "Must we pity put-upon parents sacrificing all to send their offspring to private school? | Catherine Bennett | The Guardian", "caption": "The rightwing media are full of faux outrage about Labour’s plans to apply VAT to fees", "author": "Catherine Bennett", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/02/must-we-pity-put-upon-parents-sacrificing-all-to-send-their-offspring-to-private-school", "text": "Given that the overwhelming majority of people are state educated and receive zero, or less, benefit from private schools, there is something almost impressive – when it doesn’t look actively demented – about current media campaigns to represent the application of VAT to school fees as a burning election issue.From the first, Labour’s proposal to end private schools’ exemption and spend the revenue on state schools had a dramatic impact on Tory-sympathising news sources previously unbothered about the private sector becoming, as Civitas summarised it, “roughly twice as expensive in one generation”. Overnight, thanks to Keir Starmer’s plan, it was understood that British private schools, far from being an ever more exclusive service for the most affluent, are dear to countless immiserated parents whom the Mail, highlighting their plight, goes so far as to call “poor”. Some of them are so hard up, journalists report, they live in modest houses, drive “old bangers” and, when they don’t “sacrifice” meals out, deny themselves West End shows. The forgoing of one possible purchase for the sake of another is invariably known, in the lexicon of pro-private school coverage, as a sacrifice.It follows, somehow, that the public should do whatever it takes to protect this formerly obscure minority of a minority: unfortunate private school parents who have survived Liz Truss and the cost of living crisis, only to face the brutal prospect of state education. The alternative being, it is predicted, so many refugees that state schools will be overrun, unable to cope, and Starmer’s scheme will be fiscally counterproductive.Or maybe it won’t. In the past, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies says in its assessment of the scheme, private school parents have tended to absorb fee increases.All this has been exhaustively explored, but the impact of the election announcement in the rightwing press, if nowhere else, has been to intensify the existing passion around what might appear a relatively niche political issue, perhaps even a moderate-looking compromise. There were once hopes that Starmer would remove private schools’ charitable status, not just their tax breaks.United in outrage, undeterred by a poll suggesting majority support for Labour’s proposal, his critics have, careless of looking obsessive, been amplifying their coverage, running more sob stories, more predictions of catastrophe, more reproaches from pained headteachers and warnings of closures: anything to make readers care about parents who may soon not be able to afford what they, themselves, never could, and take against a policy that leaves the private school system intact. Whatever Starmer does to private school enrolment, it will do nothing to protect the country from another Boris Johnson. It does not help VAT opponents that the impact of identifiable victims is apt to be undermined, as it rarely is in the aftermath of, say, earthquakes, by the very details intended to move us to compassion.One of the Mail’s innumerable reports might have been stronger last week had it omitted the potentially “devastating effect” (reduced access to a theatre) for a 12-year-old, presumably the most affecting victim it could find, “who has already appeared in a touring production of Les Miserables and a Nintendo Switch advert”. Her parents, we learned, “already sacrifice holidays and meals out”.In the Sunday Times, we met parents forced to “shop at Aldi, the German discount supermarket, and drive a 19-year-old Peugeot and a 10-year-old Hyundai”. As reluctant as one is to wish anyone a greater misfortune, you’d think they could have found a gaunt fee-payer outside the more resonant Lidl, pushing home her pitiful shop in an old pram.To add to compassion fatigue, the media’s anti-VAT hobbyists might want to note the evidence, in below-the-line comments, polls and elsewhere, that even their subscribers could pick more substantial hills to die on. Especially, as some point out, when the sector’s most recognisable products, outside acting, are Sunak, Cameron, Farage and Johnson.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionCritics have been amplifying their coverage, running more sob stories, more predictions of catastropheTrue, it’s the best Labour tax-horror story going, but consider the most recommended comment under the Sunday Times piece “Private school bill for two children could hit £1.2m under Labour” (that is, £1m without Labour): “The Times’s obsession with this issue is getting out of hand.” And the second: “I feel sorry those parents don’t have more intelligent children who could survive in a meritocracy.”It was a Sunday Times journalist, after all, who discovered that a parent at St Paul’s, one of the most expensive schools in the country, had rebuked another member of a WhatsApp group, the Tory MP Greg Hands, for sharing anti-VAT material. “Can we stop assuming everyone is a Tory in this group.” And even Tories might conclude, as a Spectator columnist did last week, that private schools would be better placed to protest “had they not spent the past 30 years steadily pricing the middle classes out of private education”.If the bizarre campaigning on behalf of private schools does not illustrate, given its remoteness from majority preoccupations, the still disproportionate influence of the privately educated and their educators, it is otherwise mystifying.Why, in a cost of living crisis afflicting all but the wealthiest, are Tory sympathisers advertising the enormous sums they consider, minus the addition of VAT, to be reasonable? The average private school fee is £17,500 a year.Why, given the existence of subscribers who endorse private education but oppose its tax advantages, do editors insult these readers, in column after column, for engaging in the “politics of envy”? Some, effectively, are accused of envying themselves. Reserving for others the implication that, if they were “hardworking” and ate frugally, they too could find the £17,500.Non-users of private schools are repeatedly reminded to revisit that sometimes overlooked question: what the existence of these charitable institutions does for others.It makes no sense. But I do hope they keep it up. Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist"}
{"title": "Socialism isn’t a dirty word. It’s simply about wanting to make a fairer society | Will Hutton | The Guardian", "caption": "Labour’s leadership needn’t struggle to define the ideology; it’s in its very constitution", "author": "Will Hutton", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/02/socialism-isnt-a-dirty-word-its-simply-about-wanting-to-make-a-fairer-society", "text": "Socialism is what a Labour government does, pronounced Herbert Morrison, one of the titans of the Clement Attlee administration in the 1940s. It wasn’t a very good answer then to the perennial doctrinal disputes about what constitutes socialism that have haunted the party since its foundation in 1900 – and it works no better in 2024.So what is this socialism that Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves, Wes Streeting, Darren Jones and Jonathan Reynolds were all asked about last week, whose tenets they purport to follow even as the party wrangled over the “purge” of its left? Convincing, on-the-front-foot answers proved elusive.Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, had the trickiest time. He wasn’t so much a socialist, he explained on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, but a Christian socialist – as if faith resolved the dilemma of whether his socialism reconciles the classical definition (state and social ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange being the chief means to common good outcomes) with today’s Labour policy programme. Was his socialism the same doctrine as Jeremy Corbyn’s? Discomfited, he declared his was a socialism that “put people first”, promoted growth by working with business and so built a better society. But as presenter Emma Barnett reframed it, that amounted to little more than “capitalist-flavoured socialism”. The division could hardly be clearer or harder to bridge.To the same question, Reeves declared herself a social democrat, rooting her philosophy in liberal William Beveridge’s mission of creating a cradle-to-grave welfare state. Streeting was a “democratic socialist”, which he defined as being part of the European social democratic mainstream – but social democracy, like socialism, is in difficulty across Europe because it can’t define itself attractively. Starmer described himself as a socialist and a “progressive”, which meant putting country before party. But any one-nation Tory would say the same. For his part, Jones said he rejected labels and simply replied he was proud to be “Labour” and a “trade unionist”.All of the answers were serviceable, but all essentially defensive. The difficulty is that socialism is a loaded term representing a doctrine in crisis, which, beyond a small band of socialist faithful, too many find both menacing and unappealing. Menacing because socialism closes down individual freedoms and aspirations. Unappealing because state monopolies are inefficient, snuffing out the growth, innovation and embrace of the new that comes with capitalism. Leftwing leaders have to square a seemingly impossible circle – assuring party activists they are socialist, but defining it in a way that means they won’t threaten freedom, suppress business or unleash inefficient state monopolies. But there are good answers available, not least because capitalism, left to itself, leads to vast inequality, chronic underinvestment, monopoly, instability and exploitation. It needs superintendence and active management, which can only come from the left questing for common good outcomes. Labour must find and sustain good answers, crucial both as a compass for good government and as a foundational anchor around which the party can coalesce unambiguously as a party of the centre-left – vital to quell further descents into factionalism.Fellowship – having each others’ backs, sharing wealth – is at once understandable, and an idea to which everyone can relateStart with Attlee’s answer in 1954, which not only turned the provocation back on the questioner, but retained the moral cutting edge that makes socialism – or more accurately the ethic of socialism – compellingly attractive if expressed correctly. A devotee of William Morris, Attlee inspiringly invoked Morris’s view that socialists “believe in the kind of society where there is fellowship for all. You can’t get that in a totalitarian society, you can’t get that while there’s great inequalities of wealth. That is the hope of the world.”Fellowship – having each other’s back, working together better to secure common goals, sharing wealth fairly, believing in the “we”, recognising the vital importance of the social, cleaving to democracy – is at once understandable, non-abstract and an idea to which everyone can relate. It is fellowship (as I argue in my new book, This Time No Mistakes: How to Remake Britain) that imbues the ethic of socialism with its force – and which does not need to translate into rampant statism.That was well understood by Tony Blair who, in the run-up to the 1997 general election, went one step further. He declared an ethic of socialism – of fellowship – was the enduring foundational Labour value. But to complete the picture, this ethic also furthered a bounded individualism, creating the conditions in which individuals best flourish and better themselves, while accepting their responsibilities and obligations to society; all as enduring and as important aims as fellowship. In this sense, an ethic of socialism and progressive liberalism, accepting we have individual aspirations, were interdependent: one stood behind the case for a floor below which no one could fall; the other to offer scope for individual endeavour and responsibility, but bounded by social obligations so it did not collapse into avarice and extreme selfishness. The “floor” coexists with the “ladder”. Blair then rewrote clause IV in Labour’s constitution to express precisely this fusion and to which every Labour party member – ranging from its new ex-Tory adherents to Diane Abbott – is perforce a signatory.This reassertion of the “we” as a crucial part of the moral universe has two crucial follow-ons. It leads directly to pro-investment, pro-green economic policies dynamised by public investment, and justifies the refashioning of the savings and financial system to serve all our ends, along with active public efforts to make housing, education, health and a solid income floor the foundation of a good society. Agile public agencies superintend partnership with business – boosting what works and closing down what does not.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe second follow-on is the moral dimension. The urge to collaborate, to share and to be fair is foundational to the human experience. Anyone who does not want to partake of the common life and society, as Aristotle insisted, is “either a beast or a god”. As contemporary society, increasingly atomised, imposes solitude and loneliness on ever more people who no longer have the consolation of faith, to assert the “we” is to offer a lifeline. In the US, what to do about the epidemic of loneliness is becoming a hot political issue. It will be the same here.So 21st-century progressivism is about binding the “we” and the “I” and on that fusion to act purposefully to create a capitalism that works for the common good and a society that works for all. Government will organise itself around the achievement of great missions to deliver those ends. This is the philosophy, purpose and policy of Starmer’s remade Labour party, which could embrace all wings of the party. It would serve it well to say so more clearly – now and for the future."}
{"title": "Now they think they’ve lost, the Tories are full of big ideas | David Mitchell | The Guardian", "caption": "National service? Abolishing university places? This absurd flurry of announcements is to make it seem, once Sunak has gone, that they did everything they could", "author": "David Mitchell", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/02/tories-rishi-sunak-national-service-david-mitchell", "text": "The Tories are full of ideas at the moment. They’ve announced three major new policies in the past week. It feels like someone asked Rishi Sunak, “What would you do if you were prime minister?”, and he got really into answering. Then he must have remembered that, weirdly, he is prime minister. And the accurate answer would be: “Not much other than pander to the right-wing of my party by attempting to deport refugees to Rwanda and wait for an economic miracle while being relentlessly photographed in a hard hat.”But what a productive burst of enthusiasm! Suddenly the Conservatives are announcing plans to bring back national service for 18-year-olds, introduce a “triple lock plus” to protect pensioners from income tax and abolish more than 100,000 university places. Is all this an attempt to stick it to the young for being overwhelmingly likely to vote Labour (if they vote at all)? Was it a response to Keir Starmer’s proposed extension of the franchise to 16- and 17-year-olds, which would certainly enhance the leftwing vote?What can the Tories do to counterbalance such a youthful lefty influx? Extend the franchise to people who have died? Why should people’s political opinions perish with them? Do the views of the dead not count? We should be urgently re-enfranchising corpses. What a scandal that “the few”, having saved the country during the Battle of Britain, no longer have a say in who runs it.The received wisdom is that people get more rightwing as they get older and, with rising life expectancy because of advances in medical science, that’s good news for the right. It’s old people not young ones who are the future, and the triple lock plus is Sunak’s attempt to shore up support from that demographic. Though it raises the question of how many tens of thousands more crotchety old rightwingers might still be on the electoral roll if the Tories hadn’t screwed the NHS quite so hard over the past 14 years. Maybe they were worried those people were tipping over into supporting Reform: a future Tory government would keep people alive long enough to become rightwing but allow them to die before they get too rightwing.The phrase ‘you’ve had your chance’ comes to mind whenever they propose anythingBut why these new Tory proposals? Maybe it’s natural: manifesto launches are coming up, so it’s an obvious time for announcing policies. Labour, sitting on a massive opinion poll lead, is playing it very safe on that front. Rachel Reeves doesn’t seem to be planning to do anything at all other than move house. Perhaps this creates an opportunity for the Conservatives to knock Labour out of the running with a bewildering bombardment of ideas. Is that the plan?Possibly. But there’s no getting around the fact that the Tories have been in office for 14 years, and Sunak himself for more than 18 months. The phrase “you’ve had your chance” comes deafeningly to mind whenever they propose anything. When Reeves said she wouldn’t increase income tax or national insurance, the economic secretary to the Treasury, Bim Afolami, had the breathtaking nerve to say: “Just the same old Labour party who have no plan to cut taxes…” What?! He’s criticising Labour for not planning to change a status quo for which, as a minister in the current government, he is responsible. They should cut taxes even though he hasn’t. Of course, he’s also saying the Tories will, or would. But they haven’t, have they? If they think Labour should, why haven’t they? (To be fair, Liz Truss tried but it broke the economy.)It’s the same with all these new policies. They just make us think: “If you reckon this is such a good idea, why haven’t you done it already?” The Tories can’t get away with announcing what they would do if they won the election because they’ve already won the past four elections and we know perfectly well what they would do because it’s what they did. Their only path to victory is to persuade voters that what they did was OK, even good – or at least better than what their opponents would have done.This is an enormously difficult task given the horrendous state of the country. And Sunak’s team must have concluded that it’s actively impossible – indeed that, whatever they do, electoral defeat is inevitable. For me, that is the only logical inference from this absurd flurry of policy announcements: the people around the prime minister are certain that he and the Conservatives will lose the election. If we assume that, their behaviour suddenly makes sense. Their priority is not really maximising Conservative votes, but rather making it seem in retrospect, after Sunak has been defeated, that they did everything they could.Despite everything, Sunak’s best bet would still probably be trying to sell the government on its own record, viewed through the lens of the Conservatives’ dated self-image as a party of fiscal prudence, economic competence and legislative probity (notwithstanding the Johnson and Truss administrations). That is, the whole “the plan is working” approach they favoured until the moment the election was called. Not everyone is broke or disillusioned and millions always vote Tory. But it would still probably fail and, if and when it did, his campaign team would look like they hadn’t risen to the challenge.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionTo create that impression they need to be able to point to the efforts they made and these big ideas are evident efforts. “We were coming across as a dynamic new government in waiting,” they can say, “but the situation was irredeemable from the start.” It is with this future defence in mind that they have, ironically, abandoned the most effective strategy in order to appear to have adopted a more effective strategy. In an attempt to prove that they never gave up hope, they betray the fact that they’ve completely given up hope.Is this good news for Labour? Not necessarily. These Conservatives who think they’re going to lose are the same people who sent the prime minister out into the pouring rain, with neither mac nor umbrella, to appeal for five more years in office. I mean, seriously: what do they know?"}

Two years ago, a coroner’s verdict that the death of Molly Russell was contributed to by “the negative effects of online content”, including algorithmically delivered self-harm material, was a watershed moment. Now Ellen Roome, whose son Jools Sweeney took his own life for unknown reasons in Cheltenham in 2022, has become the latest campaigner for changes to the law in this area.Her petition calling for parents whose children have died to have a right of access to social media accounts has attracted 120,000 signatures and is likely to be debated by MPs early in the next parliament. While the online safety bill, which received royal assent in October, significantly strengthened a weak and outdated regulatory framework, Ms Roome and the other families in the Bereaved Parents for Online Safety group are right that more needs to be done.Big efforts have already gone towards ensuring that parents are not left in the dark in situations where young people have taken their own lives, and there is believed to be a connection to online interactions or material. A new power for coroners to access children’s data was agreed when the online safety bill was debated. But rather than being incorporated in that bill, it was added to data protection legislation instead. That bill fell when Rishi Sunak called the general election. The amendment and the work that went into it were lost.It now seems likely that it will fall to a Labour government to take this broken pledge to parents forward. Given the anguish of their losses, they should not be kept waiting longer than necessary. Campaigners including Ian Russell, who chairs the Molly Russell Foundation – which aims to prevent suicides by young people – and Esther Ghey, the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey, have shown extraordinary courage.So far, the tech companies have proved uncooperative and resistant to pressure. Michelle Donelan, then culture secretary, said the Molly Russell inquest had demonstrated a “horrific failure of social media platforms to put the welfare of children first”. Experts believe many people would be astonished to learn that, even in cases where a young, vulnerable teenager has tragically died, parents have no automatic right to access their accounts, or to find out what material they have been viewing. Concerns that the tech platforms take reputation management more seriously than children’s safety are added to by decisions such as the one Meta took last month, to rescind a job offer to a cyber-intelligence analyst immediately after he criticised Instagram’s safeguarding failures.In recent weeks MPs have indicated their willingness to consider a smartphone ban for under-16s. The Molly Rose Foundation and specialists including Lady Kidron believe proactive regulation and enforcement, not prohibition, is the road to take. But there is wide agreement that, as it stands, more web protections are needed. Rules barring under-13s from social media platforms must be made to work by Ofcom. Businesses must be publicly accountable for their design decisions, and compelled to engage with bereaved parents in a humane way. Last year’s online safety act was just the beginning."}

If lodged in the lungs, asbestos fibres can cause the deadly cancer mesothelioma many years later. There is a national ban on asbestos.The NSW premier, Chris Minns, responded by saying that the state’s Environment Protection Authority (EPA) was throwing everything at tracing the source of the mulch. When the EPA found that mulch had been spread across Sydney into schools and parks, media managers and some reporters set about reassuring the public that the asbestos fragments were mostly “bonded” ones which are not as dangerous as fibres. So far there have been no prosecutions.What the NSW government knew but hid from the public was that the EPA is managing an even more urgent regulatory failure in which some of Australia’s biggest waste companies had been distributing material known to contain asbestos fibres and contaminants including microplastics, lead and other contaminants.The material, known as “recovered fines” is produced from residue of construction and demolition waste to be recycled in construction and road projects, and in public spaces such as sporting fields. It’s also sold as cheap fill by landscape and garden companies.In February, Guardian Australia brought this even more serious dimension of the scandal to the public when it revealed that the EPA had conducted extensive studies in 2013 and 2019, which demonstrated that waste facilities producing recovered fines were failing to comply with regulations intended to limit the spread of contaminants.In response to these alarming revelations, the environment minister, Penny Sharpe, acknowledged that there had been “a regulatory failure”. But three months later, she herself has become part of that regulatory failure.Recovered fines are big business, with about 700,000 tonnes produced a year. And while much of the contaminated material may be more safely buried under roads, some of it is in parks, schools, gardens, playgrounds and childcare centres. No one knows exactly where it has gone because despite shocking results, no one has been tracking it. Asbestos near children is a particular worry as they are more likely to play in the dirt and also more likely to inhale fibres.How asbestos-contaminated mulch sparked the NSW EPA's biggest investigation - videoThe EPA knew that its compliance system had failed. Some staff argued for reform to restrict its uses and toughen the testing regime. It moved cautiously with a huge amount of industry consultation. In 2022, it finally announced that it would revoke the old system and impose a new one. The waste industry hit back, accusing it of taking the sector by surprise and jeopardising jobs.In a classic case of regulatory capture, the EPA reversed its decision, meaning that the old compliance is substantially unchanged today.In March, Sharpe responded to the crisis by introducing tougher penalties for contaminated waste offences. While welcome, this solution sidesteps other glaring problems around non-compliance. Prosecutions are rare and EPA staff are instructed to use them as a last resort. Companies are rarely given maximum fines even for extended breaches, and even a $4m fine can be absorbed by big culprits.The NSW Greens’ environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, who was previously CEO of the Environmental Defenders Office, has argued that the minister could issue a direction that harmful substances in consumer products be considered a priority issue and prevented from entering the environment or make regulatory changes.Guardian Australia revealed this week that the facilities found in the 2019 investigation not to be meeting EPA sampling rules included some of the Australia’s biggest waste companies including Bingo Industries and Benedict Industries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While no laboratories have been accused of wrongdoing, some laboratories and independent experts think that there needs to be reform to stop potential manipulation of results.In the absence of government action, Guardian Australia bought four products at Sydney landscape supply shops and had samples analysed by accredited private laboratories. It found that two did not comply with state regulations on pH levels and one was found to contain asbestos fibres. One of the products that passed the laboratory tests contained large physical contaminants including glass and a metal screw.You would expect that these developments would inject a public sense of urgency into the situation, but there is no evidence of that.An EPA spokesperson said the regulator is concerned but “would require more information”.Minister Sharpe has said she will wait for a chief scientist’s report, which is not due until the end of the year, before considering any “necessary changes”. The chief scientist investigations are secret and will also be subject to industry pressure. It does not investigate poor conduct or compliance.If not for a former EPA compliance officer, a Greens MLC and Guardian Australia’s environment team, the rest of us would still be in the dark about “recovered fines”. How much more needs to be exposed before the NSW government gets the political will to act? We want a circular economy but to be sustainable, it should not expose the public to unacceptable health risks. A parent would be worried if their child picked up a lump of asbestos in the park, but they would be much more anxious if they discovered that they had been playing in mulch containing asbestos fibres or another contaminants for years."}

Experts say the rigidity of the process means perpetrators are sometimes able to manipulate the system to their advantage.“It’s another aspect of the legal system that is quite vulnerable to exploitation by perpetrators,” said Jasmine Opdam, a supervising solicitor for Redfern Legal Centre’s financial abuse service.‘I literally had to start from scratch’In Australia, victim-survivors can only take out property recovery orders before an apprehended domestic violence order (ADVO) is finalised.This leaves victim-survivors a short timeframe to get their property – during a time when they are also dealing with leaving a violent relationship. Once an ADVO is finalised, they have few options.“If the victim-survivor doesn’t think to mention certain belongings they can miss the boat and it can then be too late to recover property without going through a civil legal process,” Opdam said.If a perpetrator disputes ownership over belongings listed in the recovery order, victim-survivors face a lengthy and costly legal process. Opdam said the centre often sees this issue with assets, particularly cars.“Even if the car is worth say $5,000, and it’s their only mode of transport, the minimum they would have to pay a private family lawyer can be $8,000,” she said.I’ve spent probably $50,000 on legal fees to get absolutely nowhereShortly after Tessa fled from the home she owned with her husband, she returned with a police escort to collect some of her and her daughter’s things, including clothes and blankets.But she wasn’t allowed to collect half the things she requested after her husband disputed they were hers.Tessa and her daughter lived in a caravan on a friend’s property for eight months, but she continued to pay half the mortgage on the house she owned with her husband for almost a year after she left. She stopped earlier this year so she could afford to move into a rental and give her daughter a stable home for when she started high school. Before Tessa moved in, she made another request for furniture and cookware – again, it was disputed.“I literally had to start from scratch to put a roof over my daughters head,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Five Great ReadsEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Legal Aid grants are available to only the lowest 8% of income earners.Like many other women in similar circumstances, she believes her partner is intentionally drawing out the process to drive up her legal costs.“I’ve spent probably $50,000 on legal fees to get absolutely nowhere,” she said. “I’ve been told now we potentially won’t get a date for trial for another 12-to-18 months.”No submarines: Rosie Batty agrees Aukus funding should go to ending family violence – videoPip Davis, the principal solicitor at Women’s Legal Service NSW, said property recovery orders are an important provision, but consideration should be given to allowing recovery orders to be made at anytime while the ADVO is in force.“This should come with some checks and balances to ensure it’s not being used as a tool of systems abuse by bringing victim-survivors back to court to respond to a spurious or baseless application for an order,” Davis said.Opdam said the issues showed a need for greater flexibility in the legal system to recognise the lived experience of victim-survivors and greater integration across government and legal services.“I think that the more we recognise that responding to financial abuse and domestic violence requires a whole system response, the more we can really look at how all of those systems interact and make sure that we’re not just making tweaks around the edges,” she said."}

It’s the twinkle of a man who walked a low road to a higher place.The West Australian says it’s his life journey not his cricket career that will form the compass for his leadership of a 15-man unit blending old warhorses and raw powerhitters. “Captaincy is about connection,” Marsh says. “That isn’t going to the pub for beers – not everyone enjoys that as much as me – it’s about being relatable and understanding who these guys are as people to build relationships and trust.”Marsh himself has finally won the trust of Australia’s cricket public after a torrid decade in which his prodigious talent was largely left unfulfilled. “My first 10 years, I was given a lot of opportunities and I failed a lot,” he says. “I had to learn to deal with that failure, and it held me back. Every time I failed, it got me down, and when you want to succeed and you keep failing, life gets really hard.”But Marsh’s broad shoulders were destined to bear great expectations.He hails from a proud cricketing bloodline (father Geoff and older brother Shaun were both Test batters) and announced himself to the world as a tearaway teenager, cracking the West Australian side at 17 and captaining Australia’s U19 side to the 2010 Cricket World Cup.With his belligerent hitting and canny swing bowling, Marsh was made for T20s. But despite a debut for Australia in 2011, he has played only 53 internationals in the format. This same erratic pattern has played out in a rollercoaster 42-Test career. “I’ve done a lot of work on finding perspective and detaching myself from outcomes,” Marsh grimaces of those “years when I was shit”.The low ebbs – pilloried in the media, booed by home crowds at the 2018 Boxing Day Test (“toughest day of my career”), breaking his hand punching a wall after another cheap score in 2019 – almost saw Marsh retire. “There were definitely times when I thought, ‘Do I want to play cricket? I’d ring Shaun and say, ‘I don’t want to do this anymore.’ He’d be: ‘Shut up mate, you’re not done.’”The Marsh brothers Shaun and Mitch celebrate in the changreooms during the 2017-18 Ashes between Australia and England. Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesLost in the dark, Marsh lost sight of his brightest moments: the big maiden Test century at the WACA in the 2017-18 Ashes, another soon after in Sydney with Shaun at the other end, his stunning 77 off 50 balls that won the 2021 T20 World Cup final, or the 96 that clinched the Durban Test of the “sandpaper” series and saw him (briefly) named Test vice-captain in the rebuild era that followed.“It’s taken me a long time to not let the game dictate who I am as a person,” he says. “These days I know I don’t have to be the best cricketer in the world so long as I contribute to my team winning games. I can still be a good person, a good husband, a good family man. They’re the things that are really important.”Marsh is proud he “kept trying, kept coming back.” Even in exile, he chased the dream, toiling with coach Scott Meuleman on his pre-ball routine and psychologist Matt Burgin on his breathing. Getting married to Greta Mack in 2023 helped too. Most endearingly, Marsh made himself the ultimate team man, buyer of beers, counsellor and comic relief to his teammates.skip past newsletter promotionSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So I do everything I can to be a good team man, look after my mates, reminding them that we’re there to play cricket but also on this earth to have fun and enjoy life outside the game.”It’s why Test skipper Pat Cummins will be proud to serve under Marsh at the T20 jamboree. “Mitchy is a legend,” Cummins says. “As a cricketer he’s dealt with so many setbacks, be it selection or injuries. But he’s the first guy you want in your team – great fun, great energy. He brings us together, cares for everyone. He makes us all walk a bit taller.”Never more than at Headingley last year when Marsh was a shock call-up for his first Test in four years. Walking out at a crisis 85-4, he hammered a brutal, beautiful 102-ball century, the fastest by an Australian in England since Victor Trumper’s 95-ball ton in 1902.“After that they finally stopped calling me Shaun,” Marsh says with a laugh. “It was such a special moment and I’ve felt love and support from all over the world ever since. As an Australian cricketer, that’s what it’s about for me: inspiring kids to play and love the game. It’s been an incredible couple of years … hopefully it’s a good month to come.”"}

Conservatives all over the world link immigrants, crime and border control to build their political fortunes. In Australia, Scott Morrison’s “stop the boats” campaign helped win an election in 2013, just as the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and aspiring US president Donald Trump hope similar tactics will help them in 2024.As minister for immigration and border protection, both Morrison and his successor, Peter Dutton, turbocharged the securitisation of migration. Morrison, as minister then as prime minister, introduced mandatory visa cancellation rules for criminal offenders and dramatically broadened grounds for failure to meet the character test. First, the bar for visa cancellation was set very low – conviction of an offence or offences attracting a cumulative prison sentence of 12 months or more. Policy to guide officials and tribunal (merits) reviewers were refashioned as binding “ministerial directives” to drive home the restrictive message. The minister was given powers to override review authorities to cancel visas, where previously the discretion was targeted at interventions beneficial to applicants.Critically, Morrison and Dutton also oversaw the creation of the home affairs super portfolio, throwing together immigration, customs, national security and federal policing. This saw the immigration portfolio sidelined to visa processing and enforcement. Paradoxically, it has performed neither of these functions well over time, as many predicted would be the case. The changes were built on the idea of immigrant status as privilege, with zero tolerance for persons not conforming with so-called “Australian values”.Between the 2013–14 and 2016–17 financial years, the number of visa cancellations on character grounds increased by over 1,400%. Dutton wears these statistics as a badge of honour. What the numbers hide is that this cohort increasingly swept up individuals who were “aliens” in name only. Recent deportees now include individuals who have lived the vast majority of their lives in Australia, with deep ties here and nowhere else. Many cannot be returned to their countries of origin because they are stateless; their country won’t take them; or returning places them at risk of being killed or tortured. Some have disabilities or lack legal capacity: this is no longer a protection against visa cancellation and deportation. Hence the high number of criminal immigrant detainees inherited by Labor in 2022 – and why there were so many affected by the high court’s ruling in the case of NZYQ in November 2023.Albanese announces reversal of ministerial ruling that saw criminals given visas – videoToo afraid to oppose these repressive measures when introduced, Labor is now struggling with the legacies of both the failed home affairs experiment and the human mess of mass deportations. The politics is toxic. Labor knows it and the Coalition revels in the electoral response that comes with the perception of politicians who are (not) tough on crime and (not) tough on undesirable immigrants. Dutton’s budget reply speech hit both points repeatedly.The frustration for those of us who have seen it all before is that the conservatives seem to be controlling the narrative in the face of overwhelming evidence of serious system failures that occurred entirely on their watch. These include the growth of an unprecedented labour trafficking industry noted in the Nixon review, and corruption of the system for visa processing and appeals noted in the Parkinson review. These have long been matters of real economic and societal import.The new administrative review tribunal and targeted programs to deal with processing backlogs signal progress. Kneejerk responses to cases highlighted by political hecklers do not.Some criminal permanent residents released from immigration detention may pose a threat to society. However, whether an individual who is formed here (and maybe even born here) should be removed is a different question. More than half of the Australian population are now migrants or children of migrants. Deporting a criminal permanent resident is frequently not just about one person’s exile. The impact on Australians left behind or forced into co-exile can be brutal and profoundly unjust. Historic disputes – Australia with New Zealand and the US with its Central and South American neighbours – underscore the corrosive effect exiled criminals can have on friendly nations.The much discussed “direction 99” is not intrinsically bad. It is unfair to label tribunal rulings as lacking common sense. Vested with so much power, Giles cannot justly blame others for the mess. If the system is truly broken and causing so much political grief, should we look for more than a new directive? Criminal deportation means permanent exile. Should Australia consider using judges experienced in the nuance and complexity of criminal law to decide who stays and who remains? Now there’s an idea."}

In this collection you’ll find something for every mood and occasion, including a luscious yet light butter chicken, a nourishing snapper curry and Shane Delia’s slow-cooked lamb-shoulder curry.", "author": null, "url": "https://www.broadsheet.com.au/national/food-and-drink/article/six-recipes-when-only-curry-will-do?utm_source=guardian&utm_medium=partner_content&utm_campaign=week_2", "text": "“Curry” is one of the loosest words in the culinary lexicon. Popular in almost every country between Pakistan and Japan (and anywhere with a significant Indian diaspora, such as South Africa, the West Indies and Fiji) curries can be saucy or dry, sweet or savoury, spicy or mild, meaty or vegetarian. Most do not contain curry leaves, as you might think.  \nRegardless of this enormous range of possibilities, when you hear the word you pretty much know what you’re in for: a meal that’s satisfying, big on flavour and easy to eat (the knives can stay in the drawer). Here are seven of our go-tos when curry cravings strike. \nAmandeep Sharma’s Butter Chicken\nAmandeep Sharma spent six years working at Melbourne’s Attica, the best restaurant in the country, including almost four as a chef de partie. During his tenure, this dish was one of the most popular staff meals. We can see why. The yoghurt’s gentle lactic tang and the lemon juice’s sharper acidity are the perfect foils to the richness of the cream and tomatoes. This lovely balance makes this luscious curry lighter than you might expect. \nPatty Antico’s Khao Soi \n\nAnyone who’s been to Chiang Mai will know the joy of khao soi. The soupy, coconut milk-based red curry is one of northern Thailand’s most iconic dishes. This particular version came to Australia 35 years ago with Thai expat Patty Antico, whose daughter Tania Fergusson co-owns Sydney’s Automata and A1 Canteen. Like Sharma’s butter chicken, it’s one of the most popular staff meals at the two restaurants. Regardless of whether you’re a hospo worker pulling long shifts, khao soi’s hearty mix of chicken, sharp red onion, pickled mustard greens and filling egg noodles is easy to appreciate.\nTwo Good Co’s Snapper Curry With Brown Rice and Pumpkin \n\nSydney’s Two Good Co is a social enterprise that provides meals and work to domestic violence survivors. As much as possible, it focuses on comforting, nourishing food – such as this curry, which contains turmeric, ginger and a rainbow of vegetables. It’s a simpler version of a fish-curry recipe head chef Jane Strode learned at Neil Perry’s Rockpool when she was just starting her hospitality career. “It was cooked to order with coral trout,” she says. “They’d serve it with fresh semolina noodles and lightly blanched vegetables. The lid would come off the pot, and the customer would get a hit of fragrance.”\nSara Oteri’s Sri Lankan-Style Lamb Curry With Basmati Rice\n\nThis fragrant curry takes two hours to cook, but demands just 15 minutes of prep time. Like many curries, it also uses just a single pot. And the third and final big tick? A similar balance to Sharma’s butter chicken, courtesy of natural yoghurt, lime juice and coconut flakes. Your house is going to smell so, so good.\nShane Delia’s Lamb-Shoulder Curry With Green Pea Basmati Rice\n\nYou’ve met roast lamb, and lamb curry. Now meet their well-endowed offspring: Shane Delia’s roast lamb curry. This is the kind of frankenfood we can get behind. The lamb is marinated in garlic and cumin for five hours, then plonked in a coconut milk curry and cooked for more than four hours until it’s a burnished golden brown. The final touch? Finely grated macadamias, to make the lamb look like it’s “been sprinkled with snow”. Very nice stuff from the host of SBS’s Spice Journey and the owner of Melbourne’s Maha.\nGriff Pamment’s Thai Red-Curry Soup\n\nThe former executive chef at shuttered Sydney institution Longrain makes this quick, warming cross between curry and laksa when he goes camping. At home, in an actual kitchen, it’s a cinch and sacrifices nothing on flavour. The dish is vegetarian and gets its bulk from pumpkin, but you can easily throw in some seared chicken or another meat of your choosing. \nHugh Allen’s Marron Curry\n\nThis rich, bisque-like curry, from the executive chef at Melbourne fine diner Vue de Monde, marries Southeast Asian flavours with Aussie ingredients: marron heads, barramundi bones and Tasmanian mountain pepper. Clocking in at two and a half hours, this is a definite weekend project, but there’s commensurate satisfaction to be gained in nailing the four sub-recipes: coconut and cauliflower puree, blanched marron heads, marron and saffron paste, and finally the curry itself."}

The recommendation, the Israeli ministry said, included Israelis with dual citizenship.“For Israeli citizens already in the country, it is recommended to consider leaving, because if they find themselves in distress for any reason, it will be difficult for us to assist,” the ministry said in a statement.Opposition parties and government allies in the Maldives have been putting pressure on Muizzu to ban Israelis, as a sign of protest against the Gaza war.The president’s office said on Sunday that the cabinet decided to change the laws to prevent Israeli passport holders from entering the country and to establish a subcommittee to oversee the process.Muizzu also announced a national fundraising campaign called “Maldivians in Solidarity with Palestine”.The Maldives had lifted a previous ban on Israeli tourists in the early 1990s and moved to restore relations in 2010.However, normalisation attempts were scuttled after the toppling of then president Mohamed Nasheed in February 2012.The Maldives is a tiny Islamic republic of more than 1,000 strategically located coral islets, known for its secluded sandy white beaches, shallow turquoise lagoons and Robinson Crusoe-style getaways.Official data showed the number of Israelis visiting the Maldives dropped to 528 in the first four months of this year, down 88% compared with the same period last year.Nearly 11,000 Israelis visited Maldives in 2023, which was 0.6% of the total tourist arrivals.With Agence France-Presse, Associated Press and Reuters"}

Photograph: Calumn Hockey/Bush Heritage AustraliaThe species has since been reintroduced to 13 other shallow springs on Edgbaston reserve. The former cattle station, about 1,000km west of Brisbane, is home to 26 species that are found no where else in the world – including the red-finned blue-eye.The springs, desert safe-havens of artesian water, are protected by foot-high fences made of shade cloth which keep the gambusia out and native fish populations in.At least, that was the idea. But then a rehabilitating water table saw Edgbaston’s springs more than doubled in size over the last few years, which in turn caused about a quarter of the fences to be breached by the invasive pest.Dr Rossini collecting DNA samples. Photograph: Calumn Hockey/Bush Heritage AustraliaThe culprit behind the burgeoning springs is a government bore capping scheme causing the Great Artesian Basin aquifers to re-emerge. Or, in other words: it was successful environmental management.“It’s a poison chalice,” Gilligan says. “The extra spring flow increases the size of springs that native fish and other spring fauna and flora can occupy, but it makes managing the threat much more difficult.” Three years of flooding due to above average rainfall hasn’t helped either, he adds.With water now seeping beyond the shade cloth fence lines, opportunistic crabs and yabbies have enough real estate to burrow under them. Sensing an inflow of springs, Gilligan theorises, gambusia have followed. “It’s a prison escape, but they are trying to get into the prison, not out,” he says.Red-finned blue-eye fishIt’s put conservation efforts on the reserve in “uncharted territory”, Gilligan says. “We don’t know how much bigger those springs are going to grow.”Once they infiltrate the fences, gambusia, also known as mosquitofish, cause havoc by nipping at the fins of native species and eating their eggs and larvae. The 4cm-long invaders were introduced to Australia from the US in 1929 in an effort to control mosquitoes and have since been declared a noxious pest. “They’re bullies” says Dr Renee Rossini, a Bush Heritage freshwater and wetlands ecologist. Without intervention, within 12 to 18 months of a breach the red-finned blue-eye will disappear.To save the compromised populations, ecologists catch and translocate surviving native fish to heated holding tanks back at camp, poison the gambusia with a few sprinkles of off-brand vegetable derris dust (a garden pesticide), reinforce the fence line, drain the spring, wait for it to refill and finally, reintroduce the native species.For a small spring that can take a few weeks. For larger interconnected pools of artesian water, it can take a year or longer.‘It got very, very dire’: Dr Gilligan measuring fish at Edgbaston reserve.

That affords it the same protections as a national park and will ban petroleum and mineral resource extraction on the reserve in perpetuity.It’s the second property in the state to receive the status after legislation was introduced in 2020 to better protect private land of exceptional natural and cultural value.Queensland environment minister, Leanne Linard, says it’s the only state in Australia to provide such a high level of protection to private property.The agreement will “ensure this estate will remain a site of international environmental significance well into the future,” Linard says.‘Plants, animals and country have all come together here to create something really, really special,’ Dr Rossini says. Photograph: Calumn Hockey/Bush Heritage AustraliaBush Heritage Australia wants that same status applied to another four of its conservation blocks in Queensland.Bidjara traditional owner, Trevor Robinson, endorsed Bush Heritage’s protection. “The land is part of Bidjara culture, our connection to country, place, storylines, language and social practices,” he says. “It’s a place that is extremely special.”Gilligan estimates there are now more than 5,000 red-finned blue-eyes in Edgbaston, up from less than 1,000 in 2017. Despite the gains, if conservation management were to stop, their numbers would plummet within a few seasons.“It’s a constant battle, we don’t know the answers, we are trying the best we can and hopefully we’ll stumble on a solution,” Gilligan says.“We’ll just keep fighting the fight.”"}

But Richard Linklater’s latest film has a pronounced point of difference: divorced college professor Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) only pretends to be a hitman, luring prospective “customers” into committing conspiracy to murder while cops wait outside. The plot swings into gear when Gary talks Madison (Adria Arjona) out of arranging to kill her abusive husband, then falls in love with her.The film has been billed as a “somewhat true story,” inspired by a 2001 feature published in Texas Monthly magazine.

Photograph: © Mattel, Inc.It wouldn’t be accurate to say that Greta Gerwig’s spectacularly successful Barbie movie brought the toyline back into the zeitgeist, because it never left. But there’s a renewed interest in Mattel’s very famous doll, which Lagueria Davis’ new documentary explores from an interesting perspective. It focuses on the Black Barbie doll, first released in 1981 – more than two decades after the original, very white Barbie premiered.The film reportedly draws on the famous “doll test” from the 1940s, which found that children of colour assigned positive characteristics to white dolls and negative characteristics to the Black ones. Variety’s Lisa Kennedy described the film as a “jam- packed” and “wryly playful” investigation.Honourable mentions: Hitler and the Nazis: Evil on Trial (TV, 5 June), Sweet Tooth season 3 (TV, 6 June), Bridgerton: Season 3 Part 2 (TV, 13 June), Parasite (film, 15 June), Taken (film, 15 June), Trigger Warning (film, 21 June).StanPriscillaFilm, US, 2023 – out 1 JuneIn news that’ll surprise no one who is familiar with either director, Sofia Coppola’s film about Priscilla Presley is very different to Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis biopic, released the previous year. It’s an elegant adaptation of Priscilla Presley’s 1985 memoir, with a very captivating Cailee Spaeny playing the eponymous character, who meets Elvis (Jacob Elordi) at a party when she’s just 14 and he was 24.Unfolds as it does from its subject’s perspective, the film leaves judgments around Elvis potentially being a groomer to the viewer: suffice to say, it certainly doesn’t present him in a flattering light. There’s a swelling sense of emptiness in this stylistically beautiful film; an aching feeling that the protagonist’s spirits are slowly being drained.Hotel CocaineTV, Canada, 2024 – out 17 JuneChris Brancato, co-creator of Narcos, carves up some more marching powder for his new show revolving around Miami’s Mutiny Hotel, described by the official press materials as “Casablanca on cocaine”. Danny Pino plays its general manager, Roman Compte, who explains in the trailer that the hotel was “neutral territory, where drug dealers avoided killing each other because everybody was having too much fun”. But good times don’t last forever, with all those murderous criminals and party-crashing cops and what-not.Revealed: Otto By OttoFilm, Australia, 2024 – out 16 JuneThe great Australian actor Barry Otto is the subject of this documentary exploring his 50 plus year career, dotted with lots of Aussie classics – from Bliss to Strictly Ballroom, Cosi and The Dressmaker.

And, as the title implies, it is a family affair, directed by Otto’s daughter Gracie.Honourable mentions: Wild Winter (TV, 1 June), Trailblazers (TV, 4 June), Groundhog Day (film, 5 June), Freeman (film, 6 June), Speed (film, 10 June), I, Robot (film, 12 June), Sex Tape (film, 13 June), Moulin Rouge (film, 14 June), Super (film, 20 June), Exposure (TV, 20 June), McEnroe (film, 26 June).Prime VideoMy Lady Jane season 1TV, UK, 2024 – out 27 JuneLike the recent Netflix film Damsel, this adaptation of a bestselling young adult book series was conceived to counter the timeworn “damsel in distress” trope, whereby a woman in trouble inevitably waits for a man to rescue her. This show reimagines the tale of Lady Jane Grey (played by Emily Bader), who was queen of England for just nine days before she was deposed and executed the following year.The trailer takes a flippantly revisionist tone, raising a middle finger to history, the official synopsis declaring that “we’re retelling history the way it should have happened: the damsel in distress saves herself”.Honourable mentions: Hannibal seasons 1-3 (TV, 1 June), Jerry Maguire (film, 1 June), Rolling Thunder (film, 1 June), Stand by Me (film 1, June), Taking of Pelham One Two Three (film, 1 June), Looking for Alibrandi (film, 4 June), The Boys season 4 (TV, 13 June), Promising Young Woman (film, 18 June), Anyone But You (film, 21 June), I Am: Céline Dion (film, 25 June).BingeHouse of the Dragon season 2TV, US, 2024 – out 17 JuneDragons, dragons, dragons! A Game of Thrones spin-off centered around those flying pyromaniacs practically sold itself. And yet the first season didn’t have enough dragons, in my opinion, and also felt paralysed by its own grandeur, afraid or unwilling to take risks.There’s no doubt however that the arrival of the second season is a cultural event. Showrunner Ryan Condal has indicated he will address the dragon deficient, announcing that five new ones will flap their wings in season two. The story continues to revolve around the Targaryen dynasty and a civil war that takes place approximately 200 years before the events of GoT.FantasmasTV, US, 2024 – out 8 JuneI’ve watched the first episode of this surreal Emma Stone-produced comedy series created, written and directed by Julio Torres, and can assure you there’s nothing else out this month remotely like it. Based in a bizarro alternate world, lit up with overripe neon colours, a very loose storyline follows Torres’ orange-haired protagonist as he searches for a lost earring in New York City.The narrative trajectory seems to be inspired by the rhythms of dreams, taking long chunky detours and side steps, including a bizarre parody of an Alf-like TV show, with Paul Dano playing a man who gets frisky with a fluffy puppet-like alien creature. It’s strange in very self-conscious ways, with notes of David Lynch and Michel Gondry.Honourable mentions: The Craft (film, 1 June), Ren Faire (TV, 3 June), Am I OK? (film, 6 June), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (film, 6 June), Dumb Money (film, 10 June), Saw X (film, 28 June).skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But his celebrity-shedding performance in the Safdie brothers’ gritty streetside drama might be his best.Taking place over 24 hours, the film follows bank-robbing brothers Connie (Pattinson) and Nick (Ben Safdie) in a high octane plot involving stolen money and LSD. There’s bust-ins, break-outs and on-the-run action, executed with Scorsesean verisimilitude. Pattinson’s wild performance has the explosive charge of a young Al Pacino or Robert De Niro.Film, US, 1997 – out 1 JuneRobert Zemeckis’ classic sci-fi ponders the relationship between science and science fiction, significant breakthroughs often synonymous with great imagination and longing. Jodie Foster’s stargazing scientist fulfils a lifelong ambition when she discovers an encoded message from aliens, which she discovers is a series of instructions (slightly more elaborate than your average Ikea ensemble) on how to build a transportation machine. The more the story progresses, the more it engrosses – all the way to a very tripping ending.Dark AgeFilm, Australia, 1987 – out 7 JuneArch Nicholson’s creature feature about a group hunting for a 25-foot crocodile begins iconically: the late and great David Gulpilil in an Akubra hat, on horseback herding cattle. From that moment there’s an energy to this film that really sings. The aforementioned croc has the respect of local Aboriginal people, and also John Jarratt’s wildlife ranger, who’s assisted in his expedition by Gulpilil’s Adjaral and Burnam Burnam’s Oonadabund. The film was shot by Andrew Lesnie, who won an Oscar for his work on The Fellowship of the Ring.Honourable mentions: The Fringe Dwellers (film, 1 June), The Tracker (film, 1 June), Mad Dog Morgan (film, 1 June), Contact (film, 1 June), Pride (TV, 1 June), Bosch: Legacy (TV, 6 June), Emily (film, 6 June), Snatch (film, 7 June), Tiny Beautiful Things (TV, 10 June), The Fortress (TV, 13 June), Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (film, 28 June).ABC iViewAustinTV, Australia, 2024 – out 9 JuneThe eponymous character, a man on the autism spectrum (Michael Theo), prepares to introduce himself to his father, Julian (Ben Miller), a children’s author unaware of his existence who is going through a career crisis, having accidentally retweeted or re-Xed a neo-Nazi. The plotlines converge when the self-centered and scheming Julian cottons on to the idea that uniting with his son might help rehabilitate his image.The jokes are often laugh-out-loud funny and the performances very entertaining – Theo lovable and charming, Miller perfect as a babbling Brit with an amazing ability to drown in his own words. I flew through all eight episodes.Ladies in BlackTV, Australia, 2024 – out 16 JunePeriod dramas are catnip to ABC viewers, and who doesn’t enjoy watching people wearing beautiful clothes? Ladies in Black follows on from Bruce Beresford’s 2018 film of the same name, which was based on Madeleine St John’s 1993 novel The Women in Black, revolving around employees of the ladieswear section of a Sydney department store circa 1959. The TV show moves into the 1960s, as they – according to the official synopsis – “face tumultuous lives navigating societal shifts and personal challenges”. The cast includes Debi Mazar, Miranda Otto, Jessica De Gouw and Kate Box.Honourable mentions: Not Going Out (TV, 3 June), Speechless (TV, 3 June), ER (TV, 3 June), ABBA: Against The Odds (film, 9 June), Bluey Minisodes (TV, 16 June).Disney+The Bear season 3TV, US, 2024 – out 27 JuneCarmy, the head chef! Sydney, the chef de cuisine! Marcus, who makes those beautiful pastries! There’s lots of excellent characters in The Bear. The second season of this well-loved and critically acclaimed drama changed its key location from a humble sandwich shop to a fine dining restaurant, that process creating much commotion and consternation. The show can be terribly stressful one moment, heart-rending or heartwarming the next. So far there’s been no indication that the quality will drop, so bring on season three.Honourable mentions: Clipped (TV, 4 June), The Acolyte (TV, 5 June), Becoming Karl Lagerfeld (TV, 7 June), Under the Bridge (TV, 12 June), Diane von Furstenberg: Woman in Charge (TV, 25 June).Apple TV+Bread and RosesFilm, 2023, Afghanistan/US – out 21 JuneA still from the documentary Bread and Roses.

The latest begins with Jake Gyllenhaal’s lawyer Rusty Sabich giving the jury a spiel about how his job is to prove reasonable doubt; soon he’ll be the accused. Well, soon-ish: the first episode of Presumed Innocent (all I’ve watched so far) only just gets around to implicating him in the murder of his colleague and lover Carolyn (Renate Reinsve). The series was executive produced by JJ Abrams, adapting Scott Turow’s 1987 of the same name.Honourable mentions: Land of Women (TV, 26 June), Fancy Dance (film, 28 June), WondLa (TV, 28 June)."}

That 1997 classic was Curry’s second film role and gave him his big break. In the years that followed, he’d go on to appear in Australian movies including The Wog Boy, The Nugget and Take Away, plus a notable turn in the Graham Kennedy biopic The King and a slew of TV roles. His latest role is in Favourites, a short film about a couple faced with an impossible choice when their family camping trip goes awry.On set, Curry is often required to take his wedding ring off – a recipe for disaster for someone prone to misplacing things. Here, the actor tells us about that very important and now-missing piece of jewellery, and shares the stories of two other important belongings.What I’d save from my house in a fireMy guitar. I got it directly from the factory in 1994. It was the very first semi-acoustic Maton, and it’s been my favourite guitar for 30 years. I’ve ruined a prodigious number of campfires with it.If my house was on fire, I’d sit out the front, watching it burn down, rip into the theme song from St Elmo’s Fire and hope to God that my insurance is up to date. Although I’m pretty sure it’s not. Then, if there was anyone left around the fire cooking marshmallows, I’d rip into a reggae version of Nikki Webster’s Strawberry Kisses to send the stragglers on their way. But not before I’d asked them if they were the one who burnt my house down.My most useful objectMy mechanical redgum splitter. I’ve got a 20-acre property in the Macedon Ranges in Victoria which has a lot of trees and a lot of wood. So I need a wood splitter to do my bit to keep the place looking beautiful and keep my children’s feet warm in winter.My splitter’s name is Nikole Splitovic (although she prefers “Nikki Splitz”) and I love her. She fills me with a sense of unbridled manliness that can only be achieved from the sound and unmistakable aroma of eucalyptus being unceremoniously ruptured. And she’s red, so she does it faster than the blue ones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a professional pretender, I’m regularly forced to play characters who aren’t married and therefore it’s incumbent upon me to bring out the Meadow Lea and ease the ring off my finger. However, being a bit ditzy at the best of times, I’ll often forget where I put it. Usually someone turns up with the shiny ring and says, “Is this your ring I found in the sink of the makeup truck?”On my current job, no one’s done that as yet. My wife will find out about it upon reading this article, so all I can hope is that she doesn’t leave me because I was more comfortable admitting it to the entire readership of the Guardian than to my soulmate.That’s why I love doing films like Favourites, because I was married in that one.

I am less afraid to swim in the ocean than run in a forest alone | Eleanor Limprecht | The Guardian", "caption": "A man might be safe or dangerous, but it is the weighing up of risks that keeps women vigilant", "author": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/03/shark-or-man-i-am-less-afraid-to-swim-in-the-ocean-than-run-in-a-forest-alone", "text": "“Aren’t you afraid of sharks?” the man asks.We have just met and we’re talking about ocean swimming, which I have practised for a few years now. I started my forays into the ocean with the women I normally run with. Two have bronze medallions, so if I struggle there will be not one, but two people to save me.Swimming in the ocean (after I learned not to swallow mouthfuls of seawater) is thrilling. There are blue gropers, sea turtles, and wobbegong sharks. Beneath is deep blue water. Schools of tiny luminous fish dart past and silver bubbles roll off my fingers. Swimming in winter is especially exhilarating: the emptiness of the beach, the water temperature not much colder than the air, and the way the neoprene wetsuit muffles the cold. I watch for the spray of whales on the horizon. There is the different perspective – not just looking out at the ocean but being in it. And there is the fear of sharks.But while the primal fear is always there, my logical mind knows better. Only four people died of shark attacks in Australia in 2023, and there were only 15 unprovoked shark incidents. I am more likely to get hit by lightning (100 a year). Or die in a road accident (1,266).I run more than I swim, sometimes with these women, sometimes with my dog, sometimes alone. Recently I was in regional Victoria for a holiday and I laid out my running things as I went to bed, excited to explore new trails the following morning. But then I woke up in the middle of the night, remembering. Wasn’t it regional Victoria where Samantha Murphy – a 51-year-old mother of three went missing after going for a trail run? A 22-year-old man was charged with murder over her disappearance. Her body has not been recovered.I lay awake for hours, fear accelerating my heart, wondering whether or not I should go. I was in an unfamiliar place. I knew where the trails were, but I didn’t know who else might be on them. Then again, I wanted to run – there are few things I enjoy as much as seeing a new landscape while moving through it.In the morning, when my alarm went off, I put on my running shoes and left. I ran the trails alone that day. The air smelled of dry gum leaves and distant back burns. Sweat cooled on my skin and gravel and twigs crunched beneath my feet. I had already decided that if I heard someone approaching I would duck off the trail and hide, but I didn’t see or hear a single person. Just the graceful hop and thump of kangaroos.The point is that women must constantly anticipate the risk. The burden of staying safe sits on our shouldersI don’t know any men who have lain awake at night wondering if it is safe to run alone.Fear is caused by the threat of impending danger, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, and statistically women are far more likely to be in danger from a man than from a wild animal. In the United States, some female runners have taken the extreme measure of carrying a gun.One in three women will experience sexual or physical violence in their lifetime, according to the World Health Organization. In Australia, women are being killed on average once a week. But the numbers from 2024 are already higher – recently there were nine women murdered in 18 days. That is not one woman a week, that is one woman every other day.There is so much more to fear.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Five Great ReadsEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Seven out of eight say a bear. Of course, we don’t have bears in Australia, but I understand their responses. I know what to expect from bears, how to avoid provoking them.One woman responds: “If I got attacked by a bear, people would believe me.”Another: “No one would ask what I was wearing if it was a bear.”A man might be safe or dangerous, but it is the weighing up of risks that keeps women vigilant. You don’t know if a man you come across is someone to be trusted. The point isn’t, of course, that all men are dangerous – the vast majority are good. They are our friends, lovers, brothers, sons and fathers. The point is that women must constantly anticipate the risk. The burden of staying safe sits on our shoulders.So here is what I should have said to the man who asked me about sharks, instead of shrugging and saying I try not to think about them. I am less afraid to swim in the ocean, with sharks, than run in a forest, alone, where I might come across a man.Shark or man? I choose shark.

{"title": "‘No way out without bloodshed’: the right believe the US is under threat and are mobilizing | Donald Trump | The Guardian", "caption": "In ‘mirror world’, Trump is martyr and Biden is autocrat, as calls for violence erupt on internet after ex-president’s conviction", "author": "Rachel Leingang", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/02/far-right-mobilizing-biden-presidency", "text": "The posts are ominous.“Pick a side, or YOU are next,” wrote conservative talkshow host Dan Bongino on the Truth Social media platform in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s 34 felony convictions.The replies were even more so.“Dan, seriously now,” one user wrote in response to Bongino. “I see no way out of all this mess without bloodshed. When you can rig an election, then weaponize the government and the courts against a former President, what other alternative is there? I’m almost 70 and would rather die than live in tyranny.”That’s a common version of how many people on the US right reacted to the ex-president’s verdict, drawing on a “mirror world” where Trump is seen as the selfless martyr to powerful state forces and Joe Biden is the dangerous autocrat wielding the justice system as his own personal plaything and a threat to US democracy.Calls for revenge, retribution and violence littered the rightwing internet as soon as Trump’s guilty verdict came down, all predicated on the idea that the trial had been a sham designed to interfere with the 2024 election. Some posted online explicitly saying it was time for hangings, executions and civil wars.In this case, Trump was charged with falsifying documents related to a hush-money payment made to an adult film actor to keep an alleged affair out of the spotlight during the 2016 election – a form of election interference from a man whose platform lately consists largely of blaming others for election interference. The verdict has been followed by a backlash from his followers, those who for years chanted to lock up Trump’s political opponents, like Hillary Clinton.A Trump supporter waves an inverted American flag outside Trump Tower on 31 May 2024. Photograph: John Minchillo/APOn the left, the mood was downright celebratory, a brief interlude of joy that Trump might finally be held accountable for his actions. But there was an undercurrent of worry among some liberals, who saw the way these felonies could galvanize support for him.On the right, in the alternate reality created by and for Trump and his supporters, the convictions are a sign of both doom and dogma – evidence that a corrupt faction runs the Joe Biden government, but that it can be driven out by the Trump faithful like themselves.Trump’s allies in Congress want to use the federal government’s coffers to send a message to Biden that the verdict crosses a line, saying the jury’s decision “turned our judicial system into a political cudgel”. Some Senate Republicans vowed not to cooperate with Democratic priorities or nominees – effectively politicizing the government as recompense for what they claim is a politicization of the courts.They echoed a claim Trump himself has repeatedly driven home to his followers: that his political opponents, namely Biden, are a threat to democracy, a rebrand of how Biden and Democrats often cast Trump. For his most ardent followers, the stakes of the 2024 election are existential, the idea that he might lose a cause for intense rhetoric and threats.And, for some, the convictions provide another reason to take matters into their own hands during a time when support for using violence to achieve political goals is on the rise. Indictments against Trump fueled this support, surveys have shown.Some rightwing media and commentators, like Bongino and the Gateway Pundit, displayed upside-down flags on social media, a sign of distress and a symbol among Trump supporters that recently made the news because one flew at US supreme court justice Samuel Alito’s home after the insurrection.Trump supporters outside Trump Tower on 31 May 2024. Photograph: Julia Nikhinson/APThe terms “banana republic” and “kangaroo court” flew around, as did memes comparing Biden to Nazi or fascist leaders. Telegram channels lit up with posts about how the end of the US was solidified – unless Trump wins again in November.“If we jail Trump, get rid of Maga, end the electoral college, ban voter ID, censor free speech, we’ll save democracy,” says one meme in a QAnon channel on Telegram that depicts Biden in a Nazi uniform with a Hitler mustache.Tucker Carlson, the rightwing media heavyweight, waxed apocalyptic: “Import the third world, become the third world. That’s what we just saw. This won’t stop Trump. He’ll win the election if he’s not killed first. But it does mark the end of the fairest justice system in the world. Anyone who defends this verdict is a danger to you and your family.”Trump’s supporters also opened their wallets, sending a “record-shattering” $34.8m in small-dollar donations to Trump’s campaign on Thursday, the Trump campaign claimed.The massive haul came after Trump declared himself a “political prisoner” (he is not in prison) and declared justice “dead” in the US in a dire fundraising pitch.“Their sick & twisted goal is simple: Pervert the justice system against me so much, that proud supporters like YOU will SPIT when you hear my name,” Trump’s campaign wrote. “BUT THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN!

Posts calling 5 November a new “independence day” and comparing 2024 to 1776 – but a revolution not against the British, but among Americans for the control of the country – spread widely.Misinformation and rumors spread as well, with the potential that these rumors could lead to further action by Republicans to avenge Trump.Trump supporters outside Trump Tower in New York City on 31 May 2024. Photograph: Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty ImagesIn one viral claim, people say it’s not clear what crimes Trump even committed (the charges for falsifying documents are listed in detail in the indictment, and have been broken down piece by piece by the media). In another, posts claim the judge gave incorrect instructions to the jury before deliberations, which an Associated Press fact check deemed false.Suggestions that the conviction was an “op” or a “psyop” – meaning a planned manipulation, a common refrain on the far right whenever something big happens – spread as well.Talk quickly went to what Maga should do to stand up for Trump, and about how the verdict’s fans, and Democrats in general, would come to regret seeking accountability in the courts.“This is going to be the biggest political backfire in US history,” the conservative account Catturd posted on Truth Social. “I’m feeling a tremendous seismic shift in the air.”Kash Patel, a former Trump administration staffer and ally, suggested one way forward: Congress should subpoena the bank records of Merchan’s daughter, he said. The daughter became a frequent target throughout the trial – she worked as a Democratic consultant and has fundraised for Democratic politicians. Ohio senator JD Vance called for a criminal investigation into Merchan, and potentially his daughter, whom Vance said was an “obvious beneficiary of Merchan’s biased rulings”.Trump supporters across the street from Trump Tower on 31 May 2024.

We’ve seen how they run the tables in this crooked process. But you’ve got to say, hey, I’m more determined than ever to set things right.”"}

Hamas says they want a ceasefire. This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it. Hamas needs to take the deal,” he said.But in remarks on Saturday, Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, immediately undermined Biden, reiterating that Israel seeks the complete destruction of the Palestinian militant group before it will agree to ending the war. Any deviation from that condition is a “non-starter”, he said.Hamas provisionally welcomed the president’s announcement, although it also said as recently as Thursday that it still views a full withdrawal of Israeli troops as a precondition to talks.Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera: “Biden’s speech included positive ideas, but we want this to materialise within the framework of a comprehensive agreement that meets our demands.”As expected, Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners – the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, and the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir – immediately voiced opposition to the new truce plan when Shabbat ended on Saturday night, threatening to resign if it goes ahead.Such a deal would be “foolhardy, constituting a victory for terrorism and a threat to Israel’s national security,” Ben-Gvir, the head of the ultranationalist Jewish Power party, said on X.An aide to the prime minister confirmed on Sunday that Israel had put the framework forward, but described it as “flawed” and in need of more work.However, Netanyahu is also under increasing pressure from his military and intelligence chiefs, as well as the centrist members of his war cabinet, to accept a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Benny Gantz, a leading rival who joined Netanyahu’s emergency unity government after 7 October, has said he will resign if the prime minister does not commit to a “day after” plan for Gaza by 8 June.Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader, also urged Netanyahu to agree to a hostage and ceasefire deal, saying his centrist Yesh Atid party would support it even if rightwing factions in the government rebelled – meaning a deal would be likely to pass in parliament.“The government of Israel cannot ignore President Biden’s consequential speech. There is a deal on the table and it should be made,” he said on Saturday.Netanyahu, long plagued by corruption charges he denies, sees staying in office as his best chance of avoiding prosecution, as well as putting off investigations and hearings into the security failures that contributed to Hamas’s 7 October assault.During Saturday night’s now-weekly protest in Tel Aviv led by the families of hostages held by Hamas, thousands of people called on the government to act on the new proposal. A joint statement from ceasefire mediators the US, Egypt and Qatar said the three countries “jointly call on both Hamas and Israel to finalise the agreement … [to] bring immediate relief both to the longsuffering people of Gaza as well as the longsuffering hostages and their families”.Despite Biden’s description of the peace deal as an Israeli proposal, the president’s speech – his most pointed call to date for the war to end – appeared to be designed to pressure the Israeli government into coming to the table, as well as Hamas.On Sunday, the White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said in an interview with ABC News: “We have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal as was transmitted to them, an Israeli proposal – then Israel would say yes.”skip past newsletter promotionOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn his remarks on Friday, Biden anticipated rightwing opposition to a deal, saying: “I’ve urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal despite whatever pressure comes … Think of what will happen if this moment is lost.“Lose this moment, [and continue] an indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will only bog down Israel and Gaza and further Israel’s isolation in the world.”Gershon Baskin, an Israeli peace activist and former negotiator with Hamas, told the Associated Press: “It was a very good speech … It seems that Biden is trying to force it on the Israeli government. He was clearly speaking directly to the Israeli people.”Friday’s announcement is the third “last-ditch” ceasefire proposal endorsed by the US: in February, a Ramadan ceasefire that Biden said was “very close” did not materialise, and some progress towards a new truce last month was scuppered by the launch of Israel’s invasion of Rafah, the last pocket of Gaza to be spared ground fighting.There is only one substantial difference between the new plan and previous proposals: the first phrase, which is a six-week ceasefire in which a limited number of Israeli hostages would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, would be indefinitely extendable while negotiators thrash out the next stage.In phase two, all remaining hostages would be released, Israel would completely withdraw from Gaza, and both parties would commit to a lasting truce. The third phrase is supposed to implement as-yet unspecified plans for Gaza’s future, including administration and reconstruction.About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Hamas’s assault on 7 October, with a further 250 taken hostage: about 100 were released in a week-long ceasefire in November.More than 36,000 people have been killed by Israel in the war in Gaza – according to the Palestinian health ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths – which has decimated the strip’s infrastructure, displaced 85% of the population from their homes and created a dire humanitarian crisis. Israel’s decision to invade Rafah last month has significantly disrupted aid deliveries, leading relief organisations to again warn of widespread famine.Biden’s initial full-throated support for Israel’s right to defend itself after the 7 October attack has given way to censure of the suffering and death in Gaza after widespread criticism at home over his position on the war. However, the US remains the Jewish state’s most important ally and principal weapons supplier.Being seen to broker an end to the conflict in Gaza would be a foreign policy boon for the president, who is facing an uphill battle for re-election in November."}

The increase affects about one in four employees from 1 July.The increase will raise the minimum weekly wage to $915.90 (up from $882.80). Hourly wages will increase to $24.10 (from $23.23), the commission said.The commission panel argued it was “not appropriate at this time to increase award wages by any amount significantly above the inflation rate, principally because labour productivity is no higher than it was four years ago and productivity growth has only recently returned to positive territory”.According to the federal budget released in May, consumer price inflation would end this financial year at 3.5% and retreat to 2.75% by June 2024. The Reserve Bank’s latest forecasts – released prior to the budget – forecast annual inflation to be 3.8% for the current quarter and ease to 3.2% by this time next year.The commission on Monday suggested it was concerned that a bigger boost could hurt sectors typically staffed by minimum-wage workers.“We have taken into account that the labour market and business profit growth overall remain strong, but the picture is less positive in some of the industry sectors which contain a large proportion of modern-award-reliant employees,” the panel said.Jobs in the retail sector, for instance, shrank 1.3% in the year to December, with hours rising 0.3%. The accommodation and food service sector fared worse, with job numbers sinking 2.9% and hours worked falling 5.8%, the commission noted.By contrast, jobs in the health care and social assistance sector rose 9.2% and hours worked jumped by the same amount.The 3.75% annual increase compares with the 4.1% pace of wage price index growth in the year to March. Employer bodies such as AiGroup had called for a 2.8% increase while the ACTU wanted a 5% rise.In a nod to the RBA, the panel said it viewed the 3.75% increase as “consistent with the forecast return of the inflation rate to below 3% in 2025”.The RBA has an inflation range of 2%-3%, and may not wait for inflation to dip back into that spread before it starts to cut interest rates.Prior to the decision, ANZ forecast a 3.5-4% verdict while Westpac said “anywhere in the 4–4.5% range seems reasonable”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wage increases have tended to lag price rises over the past few years, only overtaking annual inflation earlier this year.Investor reaction to the news was modest. The Australian dollar was little changed at about 66.6 US cents while the stock market added to its early gains to be about 1% higher for the day."}

Sydney continues to have the priciest homes in the country.The median wage is substantially lower in Queensland than Victoria or the ACT. With hundreds of Queenslanders sleeping rough on an average night, housing is expected to be a key issue in the lead-up to the October election.At a press conference announcing plans to build 600 new modular homes, the housing minister, Meaghan Scanlon, said the problem was a lack of supply.“We know there’s a lot of pressure on the housing sector at the moment, particularly as a result of international or interstate migration. That’s why we’re focused on building more homes faster,” she said.“We need more affordable homes in well-located areas close to public transport and services. That’s why we’ve announced a whole range of incentives for industry and that’s why we’re working in partnership with local government.”How did Australia's housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing's fault? – videoWith record-low rental vacancy rates, sitting less than 1%, Brisbane house prices have shot up by 59.8% since the pandemic. Queensland’s per capita building approvals have been declining for decades, from about 14 per 1,000 people in the 80s to about seven in 2023.The state government announced a series of housing policies earlier this year, including “mandatory” housing targets for local councils, a pilot scheme to relax planning restrictions on new housing in return for a proportion to be designated affordable and a $350m fund to incentivise more sustainable development near transport infrastructure.The opposition has yet to announce a detailed housing policy, but its broad-scale policy document suggests it will aim to tackle the issue “with more land supply”.The Greens’ policy relies heavily on rent controls in the short term and a 1950s-style public housing boom in the medium run.Brisbane’s housing growth overtook Melbourne in January, gaining third place.Along with the $937,479 median house price, the median value of a Brisbane apartment is $615,429. Both are higher than Melbourne’s.The CoreLogic Asia-Pacific research director, Tim Lawless, said extremely low levels of available supply across strong markets explained the difference in growth rates.“The number of properties available for sale in Perth and Adelaide remain more than 40% below the five-year average for this time of the year while Brisbane listings are 34% below average,” he said.“Fresh listings are being absorbed rapidly by market demand, keeping stock levels low and upwards pressure on prices.”The housing data is backed up by a report on rents by the Queensland Council of Social Service, which was also released on Monday.It estimates about 150,000 households in the state are still unable to access affordable housing, with vulnerable families stuck in crisis motel rooms.It also found that only 10% of private rentals are affordable for low-income households.“To make a real difference for renters, both the Queensland government and state opposition need to commit to putting a cap on the cost of renting and end unfair evictions,” the council’s CEO, Aimee McVeigh, said."}

six people convicted of offences in the category “intentional or reckless injury or assault occasioning actual bodily harm”; and three convicted of “armed robbery, aggravated burglary, robbery or burglary”.Several of the 25 had no criminal conviction; many were convicted of fraud, “other non-violent offences”, or lower level offences, such as common assaults.Despite at least 16 people having been released by Labor, the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, has said on several occasions since November “if it were up to [her]” the entire NZYQ cohort would “still be in detention” or would never have been released.On Friday, Guardian Australia contacted the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, and O’Neil to ask which government and minister released the 25 people on residence determinations.Asked to rule out that the Albanese government had released those convicted of serious offences, a spokesperson said: “The government does not comment on ongoing court matters.”“The commonwealth is arguing strongly that electronic monitoring and curfews are necessary for community safety,” the spokesperson said.On Wednesday, Australian Border Force officials revealed at Senate estimates at least two murderers or attempted murderers and 26 sex offenders released as a result of the high court decision were not required to wear an electronic ankle monitor or observe a curfew.Albanese announces reversal of ministerial ruling that saw criminals given visas – videoThe ABF commissioner, Michael Outram, defended the regime by saying there was a “big difference between some murders and other murders”.Outram noted that offences “could be years ago”, as well as differences in the “rehabilitation” or prospects of rehabilitation of the person, and the potential risk of reoffending.The Albanese government has been under sustained criticism from the Coalition over both its handling of those released as a result of the NZYQ high court ruling and an unrelated ministerial direction on visa cancellation which defines a non-citizen’s ties to Australia as a “primary consideration”.Labor has vowed to replace direction 99 with an order that community safety is paramount and outweighs a non-citizen’s ties to Australia.On Thursday, Giles revealed that drones were used to assist with surveillance of those released as a result of the NZYQ ruling. The home affairs department later clarified this was done to confirm the location of their accommodation and identify nearby facilities that may be relevant to their visa conditions.In November, O’Neil sought to explain the government’s difficulty responding to the high court decision by saying it was “a little bit unusual” for the court to make a decision without explaining its reasons for decision.But a submission to Giles, released under freedom of information, shows that on 6 November, one day before the two-day hearing, he was warned if NZYQ won the case, the court “may make orders that he be released immediately from immigration detention”.O’Neil has said the government was advised it would probably win the case or be able to deport NZYQ, but the department rejected an FoI claim for the relevant “operational advice” by claiming she had relied on verbal advice only.The 6 November submission is at best equivocal on the point, suggesting there was “sufficient viability” in the option of deporting NZYQ to the US to argue the point in court, but describing the resettlement only as “possible”.It said that “legal risks for the commonwealth” were addressed in an email to “both portfolio ministers’ offices (dated 22 August 2023)”."}

I was intrigued, but sceptical. At Broadsheet, we take these sorts of hacks with a Salt Bae-sized pinch of salt. And for good reason. \nRemember that viral video of a knife sliding into a full head of garlic and popping out clove after clove? Mostly BS. Jamie Oliver’s suggestion to turn your toaster on its side to make a melted-cheese sandwich? Highly dangerous, according to the London Fire Brigade. \nOn her Youtube channel How to Cook That, Melbourne-based cook Ann Reardon has recently begun debunking bogus food hacks such as these, garnering millions of views. Sadly, she doesn’t seem to have covered this one yet. \nWith no concrete evidence about the merits of the lemon-juicing hack, I only have one logical course of action: buy a lemon and give it a skewering. \nThe test\nFirst, I subject the lemon to a few firm, rolling-pin-style motions with my hand, to loosen the juice inside. \nThen, with a wooden skewer, I pierce the lemon’s nipple-like end and stop just short of kebab-ing it. (This is crucial. Otherwise, you’ll end up with an unruly, two-pronged lemon fountain. I learned the hard way.)\nI remove the skewer and start squeezing the lemon with a full fist. After a few pulses: nothing. Has the internet done me dirty? I continue. \nThen, almost out of nowhere, a jet of lemon juice. And another. As the bowl starts to fill, I realise this is the closest I’ll probably ever come to milking a cow – the lemon like an udder, the juice like fresh milk.  \nThe result\nUn 👏 deniable 👏 success 👏 !\nThe ridiculously simple skewer method produces 50 millilitres of zingy, pip-free lemon juice. And it’s just as effective when I try it with a metal skewer and a sharp-pointed chopstick. \nFor comparison, I roll and juice an identically sized lemon with a citrus squeezer and it produces just 43 millilitres.\nThe pros\n•   No need for a citrus squeezer, reamer, handheld lever press or any other juicing contraption.\n•   Marginally more liquid for your labour (seven millilitres, in this case).\n•   Increased capacity for on-the-go juicing.\n•   Less chance of pesky pip slips in salad dressings, marinades, teas, cocktails et al.\n•   A great alternative to finger-straining said pips.\n•   Works just as well with limes.\n•   A use for skewers that isn’t cooking shish kebabs, checking if your cake is properly baked or opening your phone’s sim-card slot.\n•   Decreased Tiktok-related self-loathing. \nThe cons\n•   Unsuitable for juicing in large quantities (RSI may result).\n•   Significantly less effective with oranges."}

She is a more competitive candidate,” Mortlock told Guardian Australia.One MP said it would be a “terrible look” to ask Hamer to step aside, noting perceptions of the party having internal issues with gender equality.Andrews acknowledged these are the “sorts of things he’d [Frydenberg would] be considering”.She noted that the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, had “already said some time ago that he would be welcoming of Josh Frydenberg coming back and I doubt that his position has changed”.Frydenberg, Hamer and Allen were contacted for comment, as was the Victorian Liberal party."}

The former US president appeared on Sunday in a taped interview on Fox & Friends, a friendly forum on the rightwing channel and in which he was served up a series of softball questions by a trio of Fox hosts.Throughout the interview, Trump derided the conviction, baselessly characterizing it as political weaponization of the US justice system, while thanking the Republican party for largely supporting him.“People get it. It’s a scam,” he said, speaking of the trial. “And the Republican party … they’ve stuck together in this. They see it’s a weaponization of the justice department of the FBI and that’s all coming out of Washington.”Nearly all senior Republican leaders have vociferously defended Trump, echoing his claims the convictions were politically motivated, including the House Speaker, Mike Johnson, the House majority leader Steve Scalise, and the Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell. Since the verdict Trump campaign officials say they have also seen a funding boost of tens of millions of dollars in donations from supporters.Trump and the Fox News interviewers characterized the “weaponization” as similar to corruption in Latin American governments. He also claimed his attorney’s objections were routinely denied through the trial, while the prosecution were given preferential treatment: all familiar attack lines and conspiracy theories that Trump has peddled for months.“These people are sick, they’re sick, they’re deranged,” said Trump. “The enemy from within, they are doing damage in this country,” claiming his political opponents want to “quadruple” taxes. He dismissed New York and Washington DC as partisan areas where Republicans receive “virtually no votes”.He cited his campaign has received an influx of donations since the conviction, nearly $53m and claimed it has bumped his approval ratings in polls against Biden.A Reuters poll found one in 10 Republicans are less likely to vote for Trump following the conviction. A Morning Consult poll found 49% of independents and 15% of Republicans think Trump should end his presidential campaign as a result of the conviction.Over the course of the trial, Trump’s position in head to head surveys with Joe Biden did not shift much as he frequently maintained a narrow lead over his Democratic opponent. Trump also kept performing strongly in the key swing states needed to win the 2024 race for the White House. Strategists from both the Trump and Biden campaigns will eagerly be watching fresh polls this week to see if the verdict has had any meaningful impact on Trump’s support.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Trump on TrialStay up to date on all of Donald Trump’s trials.

These threats include FBI raids, investigations, indictments and even jail time.He has also threatened or suggested that the FBI and justice department should take action against senators, judges, members of Biden’s family and even non-governmental organisations.“He is promising to go after what he perceives to be his political enemies,” said Robert Maguire, vice-president for research and data at Crew. “He is promising to essentially weaponise the government against anyone he sees as not sufficiently loyal or who is openly opposed to him.“He has constantly seeded this idea that the numerous charges against him are trumped-up charges and it seems almost to have given him licence to openly say, ‘You’ve done this to me, so I’m going to do it to you.’”Trump launched Truth Social in early 2022 after he was banned from major sites such as Facebook and the platform formerly known as Twitter following the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Although he has since been reinstated to both, he has mostly stayed off X, as it is now called, the Elon Musk-owned platform that was once his primary megaphone.Trump reaches far fewer people on his platform, where he has fewer than 7 million followers, than he might on X, where he boasts 87 million. The research firm Similarweb estimates that Truth Social had roughly 5m monthly visits in February of this year. This compares with more than 2bn for TikTok and more than 3bn for Facebook.The study is part of a larger Crew project tracking and analysing Trump’s Truth Social posts. The watchdog says that Trump’s niche following means that the extent of his threats has flown mostly under the radar. There have also been concerns about Trump fatigue over the past decade, with some voters numbed and inured to statements that would have been jaw-dropping from any other president.Maguire said: “His comments are often reported on or discussed as one-offs. ‘Trump said this today,’ and people talk about it and then it fades away because Trump said something else the next day or the next week or the next month.“We figured it would be helpful to quantify these comments that he’s making to show this isn’t just a whim or a passing idea that he put out in the world because he saw somebody say something on TV. It’s a fixation of his, it’s a promise he’s making to use the government in ways that are squarely unethical.”Crew duly analysed more than 13,000 of Trump’s Truth Social posts from 1 January 2023 to 1 April 2024 and found that, while the former president has recently dialed down some of his more violent rhetoric, he remains fixated on threatening political opponents.Donald Trump, pictured here on 31 May, a day after he was found guilty of 34 criminal charges, has vowed to retaliate against his many perceived enemies. Photograph: Julia Nikhinson/APIts report, the first in a series, says his attitude can be summed up in one Truth Social post from August 2023: “IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I’M COMING AFTER YOU!” Indeed, last December Trump posted a word cloud based on his speeches: the biggest word was “revenge”.Many of his threats to Biden reflect Trump’s now familiar tactic of reversing charges against his opponents, conjuring a mirror world in which he claims they are guilty of the very offence of which he is accused.In one post about the special counsel Jack Smith, he warned that there will be “repercussions far greater than anything that Biden or his Thugs could understand” and, if the investigations continue, it will open a “Pandora’s Box” of retribution.In another, Trump wrote that his federal indictments are “setting a BAD precedent for yourself, Joe. The same can happen to you.” In July last year Trump reposted rally coverage quoting him that “Now the gloves are off.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Stakes — US Election EditionThe Guardian guides you through the chaos of a hugely consequential presidential electionPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In one post he called on the attorney general, Merrick Garland, to “immediately end Special Counsel investigation into anything related to me because I did everything right, and appoint a Special Counsel to investigate Joe Biden who hates Biden as much as Jack Smith hates me”.In another he asked: “When will Joe Biden be Indicted for his many crimes against our Nation?” Trump has posted about this repeatedly, promising to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Biden, and indict him if Trump returns to the White House for a second term.Trump has “reTruthed” others’ posts about Biden that are even more ominous. In June last year he reposted a clip from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene asserting: “Joe Biden shouldn’t just be impeached, he should be handcuffed and hauled out of the White House for his crimes.”The former president also posted a screenshot of a different post saying the FBI should “raid all of [Biden’s] residences and seize anything they want, including his passports”.Some posts announced plans for retribution against the specific lawyers, judges and other officials whom Trump blames for his legal troubles. Two months before he was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, he reposted a call for the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, to be “put in jail”.He has reposted calls for Jack Smith and others to be locked up and to “throw away the key.” One reTruth promised to charge the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, along with Bragg, Smith, Garland and Biden, with conspiracy and racketeering.Trump has also made threats to non-profit organisations because of their work. Last November he posted on Truth Social: “For any radical left charity, non-profit, or so called aid organizations supporting these caravans and illegal aliens, we will prosecute them for their participation in human trafficking, child smuggling, and every other crime we can find.”Crew argues that the posts should not be taken as empty threats but as a wake-up call for Congress to erect meaningful guardrails against the weaponisation of law enforcement agencies before it is too late.The group has called on Congress to pass the Protecting Our Democracy Act (Poda), which would curb abuses of power by presidents of any party and strengthen Congress’s ability to fulfil its constitutional role as a check on executive branch overreach. The legislation passed the House of Representatives in 2021 on a bipartisan basis but has since languished in the Senate.Maguire added: “It is critical in making sure that law enforcement and the Department of Justice – all of the things that that entails, both the federal prosecutors and the FBI – cannot be manipulated by the president to go after political enemies. That would go a long way to hamstringing any effort by any president, to be clear, to use those law enforcement powers to go against political enemies.”"}

The tool provides farmers with long-term climate projections out to 2070.Farmers such as Mayne can plug in their farm’s location and the commodity they produce, and receive information that can help them better understand the impact of global heating on their livelihood.A study analysing the usefulness of the tool to farmers was published in the Nature Climate Change journal this month. It measured how 24 Australian farmers perceived the risk of global heating on their operation before and after using the software.Whether the projections are of use to farmers or “are they only the dream of scientists” was the central question in the mind of lead author Dr Yuwan Malakar.“People talk about climate change being a distant phenomenon,” he said. “Because it’s something happening in the future, we don’t need to act on it, they say.”By localising climate projections, the study found, farmers were able to better understand future climate risks, potentially reducing their “physiological distance” from global heating, Malakar said.One farmer surveyed was planning on expanding his avocado operations but, after using the software, Malakar said, he decided to consider changing his crop altogether. “That’s the beauty of it,” he said.Another farmer from Tasmanian was fearful of cold snaps damaging their crop but said the software’s projection of fewer and less intense frosts in the region as the planet warms had eased that concern.The financial implications of a changing climate are already being felt. A 2019 report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences found the annual profit of Australian farms had decreased by 22% on average in the past two decades due to global heating.The program was funded by the Future Drought Fund. This month the government announced an additional $519m for the fund and said it would be restructured to better reflect global heating’s threat to Australian agriculture.Peter Holding, an outreach officer for Farmers for Climate Action who runs a mixed sheep and cropping farm outside Young, New South Wales, said farmers were aware becoming of the challenges caused by a warming climate.“Many farmers are recognising climate change, they are concerned about the extremes that are happening … more intense storms, more floods, more fires,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve done all we can already.”A sugar cane farmer, also included in the study, was more pragmatic. “We’ve just got to harvest when we can, and stop when we can’t.”"}

A bush-filled block of land that backs onto a national park, the farm featured river frontage and four hectares of red grapevines. “It’s a really stunning property,” she says. “We fell in love with it.”\nAlexandra bought the property before embarking on “a very steep learning curve to work out how to run the vineyard” she says. The work paid off. Today Little Cathedral is an exclusively pinot noir vineyard, renowned for its award-winning wines.Never miss a Melbourne moment. Make sure you're subscribed to our newsletter today.SUBSCRIBE NOW\n“It was a very good decision by the original owners [to plant only one grape variety] because pinot noir has been a really popular wine right through,” says Alexandra. “It’s been in demand the whole time we’ve owned the vineyard.”\nAlexandra is unperturbed by the grape variety’s reputation for fussiness. “[Pinot noir is] supposedly the winemakers’ grape,” she says. “It’s the hardest to grow, but I don’t know anything else. You’ve got to really look after the vines. The more carefully you pick them, the better wine you produce from them.”\nAlthough it’s a small wine district with just six wineries, the Little Cathedral’s patch of the Upper Goulburn is particularly well-suited to growing pinot noir. “It’s a proper cool-climate area,” says Alexandra. “We’re up in the hills and close to 300-metres elevation. We get a lot of cold nights, and that’s really favourable for growing pinot.”\nAlexandra’s debut 2015 vintage benefitted from an ideal season – a good spring and summer with rain at the right time, which caused the fruit to ripen evenly, “so the balance of tannins and acids were right,” says Alexandra.\nThe resulting Little Cathedral 2015 Pinot Noir is a robust wine that pairs well with strong flavours such as duck and truffle. It took out a raft of awards, including the Fagan Trophy and Gold Medal at the Australian Single Vineyard Wine Show and a gold medal at the Royal Melbourne Show.\n“Our pinot was the only one out of the Yarra Valley or the Mornington Peninsula that won a gold medal [at the Royal Melbourne Show],” says Alexandra. “I was really proud of that. We’re not a well-known region, but we produce really good fruit and really good wine. There are a number of people in the Yarra Valley starting to cotton on to the fact that we have a better climate up here for pinot.”\nPinot noir is picked early in the season in March, which this year coincided with the introduction of social distancing measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We were just about to harvest when it started going pear-shaped,” says Alexandra. “We always get contractors to come up and pick – I was nervous we wouldn’t get our pickers, and that would be a disaster.”\nFortunately, they finished picking Little Cathedral’s fruit before the lockdown came into effect. Since then, it’s been – relatively – business as usual. “At the moment, we’re pruning and doing maintenance work,” says Alexandra. “We can do social distancing [here] – it’s an advantage we’re not in a metropolitan area.”\nLittle Cathedral has also taken advantage of an initiative from First Choice Liquor Market, which sees small local producers invited to be stocked in their stores.\n“It really helps our exposure and availability to the wider public,” says Alexandra. “There seems to be a growing demand by people to buy locally produced products. [They] want to know where their wine is being grown and produced, and they’re interested in knowing they’re supporting local small businesses. Particularly during this second wave of lockdown in Victoria, it’s important for Victorians to help each other. Buying Victorian wine is mutually beneficial.”\nThe pandemic has also meant Alexandra, who usually splits her time between Little Cathedral and Melbourne, has been spending a lot more time in the country, a lifestyle she enjoys. “I love living in the hills,” she says. “I’ve made some good friends, and it’s so peaceful.”\nKeen to raise your glass to a local producer?

In 2022, while living on jobseeker, the then single mother took on a $250 loan with the payday lender so she could afford groceries. Three weeks later, when her first payment of $54 was direct debited, the loan had already blown out to $514.50 with fees added.“I’d be down to my last $60 and I’d suddenly find it was gone because they’d direct debited it out of my account,” she says.Consumer groups allege Cigno, headed by the former super rugby player Mark Swanepoel, has targeted some of the poorest Australians with its promise of “quick”, “easy” and “hassle-free” cash. Instead, many say they have been dragged into unsustainable debt due to the high-fee loans.In May, the federal court ruled that the type of loan issued to Grace – and more than 100,000 others, who were collectively charged over $70m in fees – had contravened the National Credit Act by issuing loans without a credit licence and charging prohibited fees. The court ordered the business to no longer collect on the loans in response to a lawsuit from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.But this is not the first time Cigno, and its associated lender, BSF Solutions, have been found to have issued loans unlawfully, and some fear that the court’s latest action won’t be enough to stop Cigno targeting vulnerable people again.‘Whack-a-mole’The federal court found Cigno and BSF Solutions had issued loans between July 2022 and December 2022 under its “no upfront charge loan model” and that this violated the credit act by issuing and collecting debts on loans without a credit licence.This was Asic’s latest in a series of attempts to crack down on Cigno that stretch back to 2019.Each time Asic took action, the business would find new exemptions in the act that allow loans to be issued without a credit licence under certain conditions. Then it proceeded to charge the consumers exorbitant fees beyond what was allowed.In 2019, Asic issued a “product intervention order”, a short-term ban on a type of lending model being used by Cigno and an associated lender since 2014. It was the first time the regulator had used this power.The same year, Cigno and the then new lender, BSF Solutions, started issuing loans under a different model.When the regulator’s successful lawsuit was launched in 2020, it said BSF Solutions was issuing more than 1,000 loans a day.Two years later, with the lawsuit still afoot, Asic issued another “product intervention” aimed at companies including Cigno. In January, the ban was extended to 2032.In the meantime Cigno and BSF Solutions changed tack again and began offering the so-called “no upfront charges loan model”, which was the subject of the most recent legal win.Cigno and BSF Solutions had conceded during legal proceedings that if an “account keeping fee” charged weekly to consumers who took on a loan was considered a fee for the provision of credit, then it had engaged in credit activity.The judgment shows the account-keeping fees – which ranged from $5.95 to $28.50 a week – charged across the loans amounted to almost $34m.“Asic is essentially having to do whack-a-mole with this company,” says Jillian Williams, of the Indigenous Consumer Action Network, which supports consumers in northern Queensland.“These really are people living below the poverty line that have been targeted by this company, and our concern is that may continue while this entity exists in one form or another.”Debt collection ramp-upAccording to Rose Bruce-Smith, a policy officer at the Consumer Action Law Centre, Cigno’s loans have tended to range from $100 to $200. Some have been up to $1,000. With the fees added, borrowers end up repaying a much higher value than the original loan.“We had one caller who received a $200 loan and was requested to pay $1,600. Another caller had a loan for $200 and had paid $160. Cigno contacted them asking for $1,200 in account-keeping [fees],” she says.In Grace’s case, she took out two loans with Cigno. The first time, in 2020, she borrowed $250 to afford rent on a new property after escaping a violent relationship. She paid back $454.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, Cigno contacted her earlier this year, claiming she owned them $1,588.Grace sent a letter to Cigno shortly after demanding it cease trying to collect the money because it had issued her the loan without a credit licence. The business responded and offered to settle her debts for $540, but she refused to pay.In the lead-up to this year’s federal court’s judgment, consumer groups say they saw a ramping up of Cigno’s debt collection activities.“We saw direct debits to Cigno in bank accounts again, and more people mentioning that Cigno is a debt that they’re having to manage,” Williams says.Guardian Australia has seen an email from one consumer who received an email offering a 35% discount on his loan if paid in full. It was sent two days before the federal court judgment was delivered.Grace also got an email from Cigno warning her that failure to pay the loan would result in an “adverse mark” on her credit file and would impact her ability to obtain credit in the future. She was offered a 35% discount on the total $1,588 debt they claimed she owed if she paid in full. She ignored the email. The next day the court ruled Cigno and BSF Solutions could no longer collect on the loans.New laws yet to be testedThe federal court also ruledthat Swanepoel, Cigno’s director, could no longer be involved in credit activity by Cigno so long as it doesn’t hold a licence.But in December, just two months after Asic launched its latest legal action, Cigno began operating under a new business, FTA Data Solutions, according to business documents lodged with Asic. The firm has a credit licence and is owned by Mark Swanepoel’s brother Ryan Swanepoel, who was not the subject of Asic’s legal action.Ryan Swaneopol and Cigno were contacted for comment, but did not respond before the deadline.FTA Data Solutions also runs Quickle, another payday lender which offers loans of up to $10,000. Cigno has in the past only offered loans of up to $1,000. But now the FTA Data Solutions website is advertising loans of up to $10,000.Bruce-Smith says that because the business has a credit licence there will be far more protection for consumers who take on loans with the company. By law, businesses who hold credit licences are required to assess consumer’s financial situation before issuing loans, and adhere to the credit act.“That being said, we see so many bad outcomes with licensed people as well, so it’s definitely not a panacea,” Bruce-Smith says.Last year, the government passed anti-avoidance measures to stop companies that morph into new models in a bid to escape ASIC attempts to shut them down. Many of the submissions made pushing for the legislation urged its necessity specifically to stop Cigno. The new laws are yet to be tested.A spokesperson for Asic says it will continue to monitor the activities of Cigno to ensure its complying with the law and that the new anti-avoidance measures are another option for Asic to pursue in the future.Grace says she is relieved she’ll no longer be chased for her loan, but she thinks more should be done.“I do believe that everyone that has paid more than they should have should be entitled to compensation,” she says. “So many people have gone through financial hardship because of these things.”* Name has been changed"}
